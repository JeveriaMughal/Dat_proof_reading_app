Examples of demarche
In July 1914, a few days before World War I began, Australia and Russia exchanged demarches
In september 1996, US President Clinton issued a demarche to Iraqi President Saddam Husain when intelligence reports showed troops massing along the border of Kurd communities.
On August 30, 1999, Pakistan issued a demarche to India demanding that the Government of India should pay compensation for the loss of a Pakistani aircraft and the lives of the sixteen personnel on board when one of its military planes was shot down.
On 15 September, 2014 the Ell, its 2 8Member States and the governments of the United States, Australia, Brazil, Israel, New Zealand, Mexico and Monaco declared their opposition to the practice of the Icelandic government that still permits commercial whaling, in particular the hunting of fin whales and the subsequent trading of fin whale products. 
The Eu's Ambassador to Iceland, Matthias Brinkmann, alongwith the diplomatic representatives of the United States, France, Germany and the UK delivered a demarche to this effect to the Icelandic government.
The Ambassador also pointed out that public opinion in the countries that are Iceland's main trading partners is very much against the practice of whaling. 
This evidenced by the public pressure put on companies around the world to boycott Icelandic goods, not to mention the pressure that voters and various organisations put on their politicians, encouraging them to send Iceland an increasingly stronger message.
Text of the Demarche
Joint Demarche by the European Union, its member states and the Governments of the United States of America, Australia, Brazil, Israel, Mexico and New Zealand.
We, the European Union and its Member States and the Governments of the United States of America, Australia, Brazil, Israel and New Zealand, wish to express our strong opposition to Iceland's continuing and increased commercial harvest of whales, particularly fin whales and to its ongoing international trade in whale-products.
We encourage the Government of Iceland to adhere to the internationally agreed moratorium on commercial whaling and to re-examine the decision to continue to issue fin and minke whale quotas.
We also object to Iceland's international trade in whale products
In summary, we once again call upon Iceland to respect the IWC's* global moratorium and end its commercial whaling and international trade in whale products.
