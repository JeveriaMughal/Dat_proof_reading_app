Examples of demarche
In July 1914, a few days before World War I began, Australia and Russia exchanged demarches
In september 1996, US President Clinton issued a demarche to Iraqi President Saddam Husain when intelligence reports showed troops massing along the border of Kurd communities.
On August 30, 1999, Pakistan issued a demarche to India demanding that the Government of India should pay compensation for the loss of a Pakistani aircraft and the lives of the sixteen personnel on board when one of its military planes was shot down.
On 15 September, 2014 the Ell, its 2 8Member States and the governments of the United States, Australia, Brazil, Israel, New Zealand, Mexico and Monaco declared their opposition to the practice of the Icelandic government that still permits commercial whaling, in particular the hunting of fin whales and the subsequent trading of fin whale products. 
The Eu's Ambassador to Iceland, Matthias Brinkmann, alongwith the diplomatic representatives of the United States, France, Germany and the UK delivered a demarche to this effect to the Icelandic government.
The Ambassador also pointed out that public opinion in the countries that are Iceland's main trading partners is very much against the practice of whaling. 
This evidenced by the public pressure put on companies around the world to boycott Icelandic goods, not to mention the pressure that voters and various organisations put on their politicians, encouraging them to send Iceland an increasingly stronger message.
Text of the Demarche
Joint Demarche by the European Union, its member states and the Governments of the United States of America, Australia, Brazil, Israel, Mexico and New Zealand.
We, the European Union and its Member States and the Governments of the United States of America, Australia, Brazil, Israel and New Zealand, wish to express our strong opposition to Iceland's continuing and increased commercial harvest of whales, particularly fin whales and to its ongoing international trade in whale-products.
We encourage the Government of Iceland to adhere to the internationally agreed moratorium on commercial whaling and to re-examine the decision to continue to issue fin and minke whale quotas.
We also object to Iceland's international trade in whale products
In summary, we once again call upon Iceland to respect the IWC's* global moratorium and end its commercial whaling and international trade in whale products.

Subject: Introduction of Urdu as the Official Language. 
My dear 
Kindly refer to the Presidential Directive No. 228 of 1984 on the subject noted above. 
In this connection, I would like to state that about 1800 officers of various Ministries/Divisions have by now completed Daftri Urdu Course being conducted by the Allama Iqbal Open University, Besides, the first course in Urdu shorthand/typing would conclude by the end of April, 1985. 
It appears to be necessary that the expertise and technical skill acquired by the trained officers/officials should not only be retained but it should also be improved. 
Following instructions are accordingly issued for compliance in view of the objective indicated above:- 
(1) Officers should dispose a part of their official work in Urdu so that stenographers/typists who have received training in Urdu shorthand and typing continue their practice and improve their recently acquired skill. 
Every officer is expected to assess as to how much work he can do in Urdu. 
The scope of work in Urdu should gradually expand. 
(2) Brief noting on files may be done in Urdu to the extent possible. 
(3) Correspondence with the various officials in scale (1-4) e.g. Sweeper, Farash, Naib Qasid, Jamadar, Driver etc. may be done in Urdu.

Secretary. (Establishment Division) Government of Pakistan
No. 1/1/73-A. R. C. Rawalpindi, the 21st August, 1973.
My dear Secretary,
I enclose a copy of the Prime Minister's announcement regarding Administrative Reforms. 
As you will see from this, the Government have taken the following decisions:
(a) All the services and cadres would be merged into of single Unified Grading Structure with equality of opportunity for all who enter the service at any stage based on the required professional and specialised competence necessary for each job. 
(b) All ' classes ' among Government servants would be abolished and replaced by a single unified grading structure, a peon or equivalent at the bottom, a Secretary or Departmental Head at the top. 
The existing classification of dividing the services into Class I to Class IV would no longer operate.
The road upwards to the very top to be open to all on merit and required educational and professional qualifications. 
(c) The use of ' service ' labels would be discontinued forthwith. 
(d) The Unified Structure would, be designed to provide for entitlement to promotions to the higher posts throughout the range of public service; for horizontal movement from one cadre to another including the movement of technical personnel to the cadre of general management carrying posts of an executive nature ; there would also be scope for out of turn promotion to the exceptionally meritorious officers. 
(e) The correct grading of each post would be determined by job evaluation, job description, professionalism and specialization. 
(f) With the merger of all classes and services into a single Unified Grading Structure, the various functional and professional services will become branches of a single service. 
(g) There would be provision that Government may take talented officers from the private sector such as banking, insurance, industry and trade as well as from other professions for jobs at the appropriate levels in the Central and Provincial Secretariats and Departments as well as Government sponsored, corporations, autonomous and semi-autonomous bodies. 
2. These orders are being put into operation with immediate effect. 
Each post would be appropriately graded taking into account the duties and responsibilities attached to the post. 
This would involve a detailed exercise. It has been decided that this exercise will be done by the Establishment Division in consultation with the Ministries and other Organizations and the Provincial Governments. 
For this purpose a Special Cell has been created in the Establishment Division called the Administrative Reforms Cell. 
The Establishment Secretary will be incharge of this Cell and he will be assisted by an officer of the rank of Joint Secretary. 
The Joint Secretary will be visiting the Ministries and Provinces for the Implementation of Government decisions and will hold discussions at the appropriate levels, if necessary. 
Before finalizing, the Establishment Secretary will hold discussions with the Secretaries of the Ministries concerned. 
Thereafter orders of the Prime Minister will be obtained wherever necessary. 
For Services and Cadres for which the Establishment Division is responsible, necessary action will be initiated by the Establishment Division.
3.	As there will be one Unified Cadre for posts included in All Pakistan Services.
The CSP Composition and Cadre Rules have been suitably amended 
A copy of the amended Rules is attached. 
4. As under the new Constitution, Government is committed to enact a law to govern the terms and conditions of Government servants, an Ordinance has been issued by the President on this subject. 
A copy of the Ordinance is also attached. 
5. The present Efficiency and Disciplinary Rules are extremely cumbersome and dilatory in their operation.
These Rules have also been revised on the recommendations of the Administrative Reforms Committee. 
A copy of the Revised Rules which have been issued is also attached. 
6. It is provided in the Constitution that suitable laws will be issued on the functions of the Public Service Commission. An Ordinance to constitute the Federal Public Service Commission has been issued. 
7. As Government attaches highest importance to the Administrative Reforms.
It is requested that references received from the Special Cell in the Establishment Division may be accorded the highest priority. 
Yours sincerely,
(VAQAR AHMAD)

From: Mr. Vaqar Ahmad	Cabinet Secretariat
Secretary, (Establishment Division) Government of Pakistan
No. 1/1/73-A. R. C.Rawalpindi, November 10, 1973.
My dear Secretary,
A copy of the Civil Servants (Change in Nomenclature of Services and Abolition of Classes) Rules, 1973, with some spare copies, is enclosed for your information and use in your Ministry/Division. 
These rules have been published in the Gazette of Pakistan dated 3rd November, 1973. 
A copy of the All Pakistan Civil Servants (Change in Nomenclature) Rules, 1973, was forwarded to all Ministries/Divisions and the Provincial Governments with Establishment Division Office Memorandum No. 1/ 1/ 73-ARC, dated 10th October, 1973.
2. The Civil Servants (Change in Nomenclature of Services and Abolition of Classes) Rules, 1973, give formal effect to the abolition of classes announced by the Prime Minister on 20th August, 1973. 
The classification of posts into gazetted and non-gazetted has also been abolished. 
However, the practice of notifying all appointments to Grade 16 and above in the Gazette will continue to be followed.
3. The above rules also provide that all Federal Services and posts, other than those included in All-Pakistan Unified Grades, shall be called Federal Unified Grades.
There shall thus be three Unified Grades namely
(1) All Pakistan Unified Grades.
(2) Federal Unified Grades.
(3) Provincial Unified Grades.
The Provincial Governments are being requested to issue similar orders to designate the services and posts under them as Provincial Unified Grades.
4. Attention in particular is invited to rule  8of the Civil Servants (Change in Nomenclature of Services and Abolition of Classes) Rules, 1973 whereby all reservations of posts for purposes of appointment, promotion or transfer in favour of persons belonging to a particular service or cadre or a particular post have been abolished.
The intention of this rule is that no individual Government servant should claim promotion or appointment to a particular post as a matter of right on the basis of provision in existing recruitment rules or other structions. 
Action is in hand to frame fresh rules in the light of Administrative Reforms. 
For example, certain rules for posts in All Pakistan. Unified Grades have already been issued in SRO 123 8(I)/7 3dated 2Ist August, 1973. 
In other cases, discussions are in progress with Ministries and Divisions concerned. 
However, in order not to create a vacuum, the existing quotas for promotion and direct recruitment for various posts may continue to be observed until further orders.
Yours sincerely,
VAQAR AHMAD
All Secretaries

Copy to the Chief Secretaries to the Provincial Governments.

If in the exigencies of service, a post is required to be filled by a person who has not been selected through this process, his appointment would be treated as provisional. 
And such a person will have to take the written test and qualify for the post in competition with others before his appointment is regularised. 
If he fails to be selected, he will be reverted. 
3. The above position may kindly be brought to the notice of all concerned as when similar call for applications was made in November, 1972, some officers did not apply under the impression that they would be considered for promotion in the normal course. 
Now that the Services have been abolished and there is no reservation in favour of any group or category of Government servants, all of them will have to apply under this procedure if they want to be considered for promotion.

D.O. Letter from the Mr. Naveed Akram Cheema, Chairman Federal Public Service Commission to Mr. Mamnoon Hussain,the President, Islamic Republic of Pakistan
(Annual Report 2015)
No.99/1/1DS (CP-1) Islamabad,dated 15 Sep 1977 
Naveed Akram Cheema,
Chairman,
Tel.0519205746
Mr. President,
Pursuant to section  9of the FPSC Ordinance, 1977, the Annual Report of the Federal Public Service Commission for 2015 is presented to the President of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. 
This report gives an account of the functional performance of the Commission for the period 1st January through 31st December 2015. 
1. Over the last 68years, since the Federal Public Service Commission was founded, its composition, size and processes have changed, but its overall purpose has remained the same. 
The Commission is chartered to recruit through fair and open competitive process, a broad range of human resources to serve the Government and the people of Pakistan, effectively and efficiently.
3. For this purpose, the FPSC develops examination modules, conducts tests and examinations for recruitment of persons to all Pakistan Services, the civil services of the Federation and civil posts in connection with the affairs of the Federation in basic pay scales 16and above and also holds examinations for promotion for such posts as the Federal Government may, from time to time, specify.
Complaints/review petitions of the aggrieved candidates, if any, are also entertained and addressed. 
The Commission carries out all recruitments on the principles enshrined in Article 27of the Constitution and the reservation of seats prescribed by the Government from time to time. 
4. In this work, the Commission acts as an independent regulator. 
It works with Ministries/ Divisions/ Departments to renovate and professionalize recruitment processes, both as regulator and in support of their work. 
The statutory responsibilities of the Commission require it to advise the President on matters relating to qualifications and methods of recruitment for BS-16and above. 
As the Commission processes recruitment for these posts within various Ministries/Divisions/Departments, sometimes, those responsibilities require it to stand up and speak up as an independent regulator. 
This report underscores the challenges faced by the Commission in this regard. 
The report not only identifies challenges related to the recruitment but also captures the reform initiatives. 
5. Like each year, goals and targets were set for Year 2015. 
Some of the key goals and targets were to improve selection criteria, critically examine, review and timeline the procedures and processes for recruitment, enhance usage of information technology and to reduce delays. 
The year's biggest achievement has, perhaps, been the 100% online application invitation and processing. 
As has been explained in the report until last year data entry and subsequent proof reading consumed  2to3 months to process; and therefore the need for an automated system for processing the applications was felt, finally achieved this year. 
It is an important development for the Commission which will be of great benefit both for the Commission as well the aspirants.
6. Another important milestone was reforms in CSS Competitive Examination System. 
The Commission conducted an extensive and intensive round of discussions with various stakeholders including HEC designated panel of subject specialists for revision of syllabi for the CSS competitive examination. 
The scheme and syllabi was last revised in 1981. 
In view of the fast changing environment and the consequent challenges, the need to reform was strongly felt. 
The new scheme for competitive examination 2016and onwards included six new subjects Anthropology, Criminology, Environmental Sciences, Gender Studies, Governance & Public Policy, Town Planning & Urban Management and revision of marks of optional subjects and re-grouping of optional subjects to provide level playing field to all candidates. 
7. In a view to bring qualitative improvement in general (direct) recruitment for all posts in BS-1 6and above in various Ministries/Divisions/Departments and to reform the ex-cadre service, the selection process was further improved through revision of syllabi and test schemes. 
It was meant to encourage the candidates to equip themselves with the required skills as well as knowledge and make the selection more competitive.
Test schemes and syllabi for 26 8recruitment cases for selection against 186 4posts in BS-16 to BS-2 0were designed in 2015. 
It is worth mentioning that over 68194 0applications were processed in one year against the aforementioned posts.
8. These highlights reflect a continuing increase in core workload across the board. 
Our Members have been involved in recruitment/ selection/ interview/ review petitions of the candidates against various posts. 
The Commission processed cases of recruitment against 3830ex-cadre posts.
Including advertised in 2015and carry forward cases from previous years. 
In 2015, 147cases were finalized for 67 5posts. 
The Commission interviewed 228 8candidates and made recommendations against 57 5posts in BS-16to BS-20under general recruitment. 
Nominations were also made against 23 3posts under CSS CE 201 4in the year 2015.
9. In this report, we also record the range of additional activities undertaken in support of improving the selection process as indicated in Chapters  5and 6.(Annual Report)
10. In Competitive Examination, we oversee directly and focus on the selection processes. 
During the year, we continued to gather data on the diversity of applications for posts at every level for statistical analysis and referencing. 
Under CSS CE 2014, applications to post ratio was 78.
Only 2.8 6percent of the candidates, who appeared, finally qualified. 
Out of 37 7finally qualified candidates, 69% were from Punjab, 10% from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 9% from Sindh Rural, 5% from Sindh Urban, 3% from Balochistan, 2% from GB/FATA and 2% from AJK. 
Out of 31 5vacancies, allocations against 233(14 4male and 8 9female) posts/vacancies were made by the Commission. 
The allocation against 8 2vacancies could not be made due to non-availability of qualified candidates from the respective quotas.
11. Similarly, 22,41 2candidates applied for the Competitive Examination (CE) 201 5but only 1217 6candidates appeared in the examination. 
The result of written part was announced on 16.10.2015 and 379 or 3.11% of total candidates qualified the written examination. 
Only 3.02 percent of the candidates who appeared in the examination finally qualified the examination.
Applications to post ratio was 67. 
The Establishment Division intimated 333vacancies to be filled through CSS Competitive Examination 2015۰ 
which were accordingly distributed amongst Merit, Provincial / Regional quotas, Women quota (10%) and Minorities quota (5%). 
Out of 333 vacancies, allocations against 23 8(13 2male or 55% and 106 females or 45%) posts/ vacancies were made by the Commission. 
The allocation against 9 5vacancies could not be made due to non-availability of qualified candidates from the respective quotas. 
12. Final Passing Out Examinations (FPOE) for 1 2services/groups and examinations for cadre and non-cadre posts were also held during 2015. 
13. This data guided the Commission to understand better both what was happening as well as suggesting why it was happening. 
The report also suggests trends and contains some analysis of average age of appearing candidates in CSS, male/female ratio among successful candidates, popular choice and performance in various subjects/disciplines, comparative performance of the candidates who pass out from private, Missionary schools and Government institutions and reserved quota for the disabled and Minorities and so on. 
The analysis helps to ensure that the problems are clearly understood, and therefore right recommendations are made and appropriate action is taken. 
14. In the previous years, comparative analysis based on the data of CSS results, feedback of the examiners of the Competitive Examination and Final Passing out Examinations, assessment of the candidates during the interviews/viva voce by the Commission and the impact on the civil service landscape also forms part of the report
Observations/ Findings/ Recommendations
15. The Commission continues to enjoy the trust and confidence of the general public in terms of competitive and merit based selection. Following are some of the observations/ findings/recommendations which need immediate attention of the Government.
 Promoting diversity in Civil Service
16. Civil Service needs a variety of expertise and backgrounds to help solve the country's diverse needs and problems. 
The CE reveals that candidates who are finally selected come from various sectoral backgrounds.
The Commission, therefore, continues to monitor these trends, informs the Government to take appropriate actions which could impact the future composition of the civil service.
Need for Career Counseling and incentivization of Civil Service
17. There is an increasing trend for high achievers to opt for the private sector as their first career choice.
primarily for fast career growth and better remuneration. 
There is a need to launch a country-wide career counselling program to attract and motivate the best talent towards civil service. 
Besides there is a need to make the service structure more incentivized. 
Recruitment, performance, compensation, career progression and retirement provide positive reinforcement. 
The civil service reforms require looking at it as one package and making it a professional service.
Improving standard of education and higher learning 
18. The pass percentage of the candidates in CSS 2015, feedback received from the examiners on the written scripts as well as the performance of the candidates observed by the Commission in interviews indicate that the standard of education remains below par. 
Competencies, performance and knowledge of the candidates remain average overall. 
It is a candid opinion of the Commission that education both in terms of conceptual clarity, learning and instruction is deteriorating. 
The inadequacies/deficiencies in education system are primarily due to sub-standard school education, particularly in rural areas and need to be addressed appropriately. 
Enhanced efforts are needed to collaborate with Universities/institutes of higher learning and Higher Education Commission to improve the standards of instruction and learning:
Affirmative actions to promote female participation in civil service
19. In Competitive Examination 2015, the number of female applicants was 3754. 
Of the total allocated 238candidates to various groups/services, 10 6or 45% were female. 
Based on their good performance, female candidates qualified in written part in significant numbers and were called for interview and once interviewed, 76were appointed on merit. 
Through another stream i.e. 10% reserved quota for women, another 30candidates were allocated to various groups/services. 
This indicate that the Government's affirmative actions to mainstream female participation in civil service have been effective. 
Given such initiatives, women are likely to show a sizable number in civil service of Pakistan and an enhanced role in national development. 
Issue of vacant seats
20. Posts under Competitive Examination remain unfilled because of non-availability of eligible candidates from respective quotas attaining the threshold. 
In CSS 2015, 9 5seats remained vacant.
inclusive of the carry forward of 82seats from year 2014.
Inavailability of qualified professionals against technical posts
21. The Commission at times does not find qualified and suitable candidates for technical/professional posts from respective quotas. 
During the year 2015, nomination of candidates against 100posts in BS 16-2 0could not be made due to non-availability of qualified professionals in the specialized fields (Information Technology, Geology, Engineering, Medicine) in 65cases. 
It is presumed that better qualified individuals make career choices in favor of the corporate/private sector, as it offers better remuneration and relatively better work environment.
Need for revision of Syllabi and training format of all Training Institutes
22. Syllabi and training format of all Training Institutes needs to be reviewed. 
There seems be more thrust on academics rather than professional grooming or towards building skills for acquiring professional excellence as observed by the Examiners. 
The Commission is of the view that there is a dire need for a comprehensive review and realignment of the FPOE syllabi, training methodology and techniques. 
Training Academies also need to identify potential development needs to enhance the officer's leadership and professional competencies.
Litigation-main cause of delay in processing of cases 
23. Litigation against various decisions has been one of the main hindrances in speedy disposal of recruitment cases. 
During the year, 314fresh cases were filed in various courts. 
382 cases were brought forward from the previous years. 
212 cases were decided during the year. 
Thus, 484 cases were subjudice in different Courts of Law at the end of the year.
Observing Recruitment rules and advice of the Commission 
24. Irregularities and deficiencies in Recruitment Rules were also noted with concern by the Commission. 
As it is mandatory for all Ministries/Divisions/ Depart- ments to solicit the assent of the Commission on the recruitment rules for all civil positions, the Commission received 190cases from Government entities for approval of rules. 
The Commission approved 35cases. However,  4cases were considered unfit and 82cases were processed to remove deficiencies in conjunction with the concerned Government entities. 
In 69cases, the sponsoring Ministry/Division did not frame recruitment rules with prior approval of the Commission and the prescribed eligibility, terms and conditions of service. 
Such appointments not only deprive potential candidates from applying for the posts, but also promote inefficiency and incompetence in civil service. 
There were 10cases in all,7under which ir-regular appointments were made without prior approval of the Commission and in  3cases offer of appointment was delayed by the concerned Ministry/Division/Department. 
There is a need to re-iterate to all Ministries/ Divisions to follow the prescribed procedure for framing recruitment rules with concurrence of the Commission. 
Need for revision of the recruitment rules
25. A set of well-defined recruitment rules is the bench mark for the whole recruitment process. 
The Commission has time and again observed several deficiencies in the way qualifications for various posts are spelled out by sponsoring Ministry/Department.
 The Commission has also repeatedly underscored the need for revision of the recruitment rules which in many cases dates back to 1974. 
This effects the otherwise qualified applicants holding a degree with a different title to apply as well as for the Selection Committee in selecting the right candidate. 
A major portion of 378personal hearings pertained to this specific issue i.e. claim of the candidates for having studied the same or relevant discipline but under a different title. 
With new disciplines/fields being taught at the university level in Pakistan, there is definitely a need to realign the recruitment rules by including/adding these disciplines. 
Revisiting the procedure for personal hearings
26. Efforts have been underway to speed up the recruitment process against ex-cadre posts.
According to the procedural requirements given in the FPSC Ordinance 1977, the rejected candidates are allowed to make representations.
 followed by personal hearings and then review petitions against Commission's decision. 
which causes a delay of about two months. 
The Commission has observed that in personal hearings, every aspect of the aggrieved candidate is addressed; therefore, the provision of going through review petition given in section 7(3) (b) which may consume another one month's time, may be dispensed with. 
 It will still be open to the candidates to approach through the High Court, if they still feel aggrieved. 
Human Resource requirements and recruitment planning be timely communicated to the Commission
27. To speed up the recruitment process, there is a need to advise all the Ministries/Divisions/Departments to keep the Commission informed about their future Human Resource requirements and recruitment planning, on a bi-annual basis. 
Commission to be on board on matters pertaining to Civil Service Reforms
28. The Commission should be a part of all key deliberations on the Civil Service Reforms. 
These recommendations aim to support merit, institutions, discipline and values in driving and sustaining high standards of governance, delivery and performance. 
This should enhance not just institutional excellence but also develop an integrated civil service for Pakistan.
29. The Commission consists of a versatile group of Members who bring both wide experience and knowledge. 
I am grateful to all the Member colleagues for the work they do so meticulously and for their wise advice on so many occasions.
30. We are also particularly grateful for the support of the Secretariat, which brings both conscientiousness and careful scrutiny to its work. 
They have risen to the many challenges that have been thrown at them.
And I am confident, they will continue to do so in the following years. 
31. The Commission expresses its gratitude to the Honorable President of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the Government for the continued support to this institution.

(D.O. Letter from Mr. M. Salman Faruqui, Federal Ombudsman to Mr. Mamnoon Hussain,the President of Pakistan)
M. Salman Faruqui (N.I)
Federal Ombudsman of Pakistan
 Islamabad, the 29th March, 2015
Dear Mr. President,
When the Almighty saddles one with exceptional responsibilities, He also bestows the strength, the determination, and the wisdom to shoulder those responsibilities and meet those challenges. 
My experience as the Federal Ombudsman, in the twilight of my career in public service, has been no different. 
Halfway through my tenure, I am at a loss for words to express my thanks to Almighty for having given me the strength and, even more importantly, a team of dedicated and committed professionals, who achieved the near impossible challenge of disposing of 77,31 1complaints in the year 2014, a landmark that would surely be the envy of any such institution in the world. 
It is with a strong sense of satisfaction and humility that I bring to your notice that we surpassed our own record of 74,77 5cases disposed of in the previous year, and the annual average of 16,58 3cases in the previous 3 0years.
2. As we continue to endeavour to surpass our own achievements, our focus and priority remain unchanged as does our resolve to bring relief and happiness to the hapless and the helpless of this country, who suffer on account of maladministration, discrimination, inefficiency and indifference of our Federal Agencies and some of their functionaries. 
As we do so, we do not forget to acknowledge the cooperation of those Agencies and their Administrators without whose understanding and help this Office may not have achieved such a high rate of disposal and compliance. 
It is a credit to our Investigating Officers that in more than 99% cases, complainants and agencies accepted their findings. 
Only in less than 1% cases, complainants or agencies filed review petitions or representations to the President of Pakistan. 
The President upheld the findings of our investigating officers in more than 95% representations.
3. It will please you to know that, we are now resolving every complaint without any cost to the complainant within 6 0days or less, and have liquidated the entire backlog of years. 
This is a distinct honour for our institution.
4. Aware of the Federal Government's keen desire to provide speedy justice to the common man for which the National Agenda for Change has been initiated, we have also endeavoured to give clear shape to a Speedy Complaint Resolution Mechanism. 
A feasible and doable proposal has been developed through research by experts and professionals working in our office.
5. A manifestation of the common man's increasing confidence and trust in the institution of the Wafaqi Mohtasib (Federal Ombudsman) is the fact that groups of illustrious individuals in different spheres of public life, including the civil society, the legal community, public representatives, officials and media, responded to our call and agreed to serve on our Federal Committee on Reforms and Speedy Resolution of Complaints and the National Committee on Children. 
Our resolve to reach out to the common man does not end with establishing more offices in the country and extending video links, but a lot needs to be done to reduce the workload on the existing judicial system and to speed up and extend the delivery of justice to the grassroots level, in cooperation with other federal and provincial ombudsmen. 
We have already requested the President and the Prime Minister to co-chair an inter-provincial meeting.
Attended by the concerned Ministers, Provincial Governors and Chief Ministers and all Ombudsmen, for consideration and approval of our proposal to reach the proverbial doorsteps of the complainants and resolve their complaints within days, and not months. 
Our proposal has the blessing of the Federal Advisory Committee on Reforms. 
6. The Office of National Commissioner for Children (ONCC) established in this Secretariat is working out a way forward for Child Ombuds-System for child rights and child protection with the help of the UNICEF. 
To strengthen this system, a National Committee on Children comprising highly credible and prominent personalities has been constituted to guide and advise the National Commissioner. 
7. The Wafaqi Mohtasib Secretariat in Islamabad and its regional offices in Peshawar, D. I. Khan, Multan, Faisalabad, Sukkur, Quetta, Lahore and Karachi have tried their best over the years to make themselves accessible to the complainants. 
Many areas, however, continue to remain out of their reach. We, therefore, plan to establish regional offices in other cities and towns and the Hyderabad office that opened its door last year is the first of many others. 
We are planning to set up similar offices in Abbottabad, Hub and Gwadar and reopen our office in Gilgit Baltistan and, soon Insha Allah, in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA).
8. It is thus with great humility and much satisfaction that I submit to you the Wafaqi Mohtasib (Federal Ombudsman)'s Annual Report for 2014 pursuant to the requirement of the Establishment of the Office of Wafaqi Mohtasib (Ombudsman) Order, 1983.

9. We have endeavoured in every way we could to live up to the expectations of those who look up to this office for prompt and just relief. 
Excellence, however, has no limit. We shall continue to raise its bar for the office of the Federal Ombudsman and we are confident that we shall continue to receive your gracious support and kind encouragement in our efforts. 
Sincerely, 
(M. Salman Faruqui)
Hon'ble Mr. Mamnoon Hussain,
The  President Islamic Republic of Pakistan

 No. 6/1/DS-A Islamabad, March 15, 2018
Dear Mr. President, 
Towards the end of my career in civil service, I have been assigned the responsibility of Wafaqi Mohtasib (Ombudsman) since July 2017.  
1 am immensely thankful to Almighty Allah for this honour, as it is an opportunity to serve the common man, suffering due to maladministration at the hands of various Federal Government Agencies.
The Year 2017 has been an eventful one as it continued to draw complaints from a large number of people seeking relief. 
It is a measure of confidence of the people, in the ability of the institution that 83,45 7complaints were handled during the year. 
The trust of the people in the institution is the result of dedication and excellent work of my illustrious predecessors over three decades. 
For me, it is satisfying to achieve almost zero pendency and proper disposal, within the prescribed period, by the end of the year.
Our success, undoubtedly owes a lot to your kind support and patronage apart from the dedicated work of our advisors and employees, who worked over time and during the weekends to achieve these ambitious targets. 
I seek Allah's blessings in the years ahead and look forward to your continued support and guidance.
To conclude, it is my privilege and pleasure to present to you the Wafaqi Mohtasib's Report for the year 2017.
With profound regards, 
Sincerely,
(Syed Tahir Shahbaz)

D.O. Letter from Mr. Abdul Rauf Chaudhary, Federal Tax Ombudsman to Mr. Mamnoon Hussain, the President Islamic Republic of Pakistan
(Annual Report)
D.O.No. 10-(2) 2015-A-II Islamabad, March 28, 2016
Mr. Abdul Rauf Chaudhary,
Federal Tax Ombudsmen
Tel.0519558352
Dear Mr. President,
It is indeed a very distinguished honor for me to present Annual Report for the year 2015to your esteemed office. 
The report briefly enumerates the performance of Federal Tax Ombudsman's Secretariat. 
This Office established in the year 2000to resolve the complaints of the tax payers against maladministration of the federal tax collectors, generally receives and decides Although the number of complaints decided during 2015(i.e. 1,610) remained within the range, yet this year was momentous in several aspects. 
During the year, the number of complaints decided in favor of the complainants increased significantly to 70%; while in quantitative terms it constitutes a preponderant chunk (1,127) out of the total number of 1,61 0complaints. 
Similarly, the acceptability of the decisions of the FTO also improved and 85% of our decisions were straightaway accepted by the complainants and Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).
2. Following the guidelines provided under Article 37of our Constitution which guarantees that the state of Pakistan would ensure inexpensive and expeditious justice' to the aggrieved persons, the FTO office took effective measures to reduce the time taken in the disposal of complaints. 
In addition, the FTO's secretariat continued its policy of self-assessment and benchmarking with a view to improve service delivery and learn from the accredited management standards practiced elsewhere in the world.
3. We also continued our collaboration and partnership with international donors and other Ombudsman offices through regional and international cooperation.

My dear Foreign Secretary,
As you are no doubt aware, the Prime Minister has prepared an exposition of the development of our foreign policy based on the adoption and implementation of the principle of Bilateralism. 
There are references in the exposition which would be further clarified by the relevant documentary evidence. 
These documents have been supplied to me by the Foreign Office from its archives. 
Even though, as Chief Executive of the Government, the Prime Minister has the prerogative to determine whether or not the contents of a document, classified or otherwise, should be made public knowledge in the interest of the State, he has, in the present case, chosen not to exercise the right himself. 
Instead, he has asked me to obtain the permission of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for their publication as annexes to the Prime Minister's own signed article.
The list of the documents is appended herewith.
In requesting this permission, I am actuated by the consideration that the publishing of these documents will serve the public interest of creating a better understanding of the orientation of our external policy. 
At the same time, it will by no means impinge on our current relations with any foreign power.

My Dear,
The Sri Lankan Prime Minister's office is organizing an exhibition of Buddhist statues, Buddhist traditions/ Artifacts/ Sacred Relics on the occasion of forthcoming Vesak Festival - a Buddhist religious event, from 29th April to 5th May, 201 8in Sri Lanka.
They have requested Government of Pakistan, through Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to obtain suitable exhibits for the aforementioned event from Pakistan.
Realizing the importance of cordial relations between two countries, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Pakistan has requested this Division for provision of the sacred Buddhist relics. 
In 2016a similar favour was extended by us by sending Sacred Buddhist relics from Taxila Museum to Sri Lanka. 
The event was widely appreciated.
Pakistan has also been celebrating Vesak Festival for past two years. 
This step compliments the Memorandum of Understanding (2016-2019) signed between Sri Lanka and Pakistan and will further strengthen the existing ties between both the Countries. 
2. The Department of Information, Culture & Youth Affairs of the Government of the Punjab was requested for provision of list of artifacts / relics that could be sent to Sri Lanka to realize the international commitment under standard documentation that may include a separate agreement with the Sri Lankan authorities. 
Their response is, however, still awaited. 
3. As a recent development, Ministry of Foreign Affairs has requested to provide the estimated value of the sacred tooth relic for having the insurance value arranged by Sri-Lankan High Commission in Pakistan.
The last estimation of the insurance value of the tooth relic along with its golden and stone caskets came out to be USD 3. 0Millions. 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also conveyed that the tooth relic should be sent to the forthcoming Vesak Festival in Sri Lanka to honour the commitment of the Prime Minister of Pakistan. 
In view of above I would request you to kindly advise the concerned department to send their response in the matter on priority basis.

No. 1(10)/HWM/2017 February 16, 2017
Dear Mr. President,
The civil services constitute the steel frame on which is raised the administrative structure of a state.
Pakistan is no exception. 
It were the civil services of Pakistan which saw through the formative days of the state and ensured that the fragile structure did not collapse. 
To their credit, it gained in strength and became a strong and stable country. 
But that was yesterday. 
Unfortunately, it is not so today. 
It was in this background that we constituted a Committee of eminent persons of vast and varied experience to deliberate on issues of raising the capacity of our new and in service civil servants. 
2. It gives me immense personal satisfaction to present this Report of the Committee on Capacity Building for Public Service delivery to meet contemporary challenges. 
3. It goes without saying that efficient and professional civil service is absolutely vital for good governance.
Appropriate training of public servants who are responsible for service delivery is therefore essential for improving their efficiency and professionalism.
4. Training is fundamental to growth, performance improvement, efficiency enhancement and capacity building. Everyone needs not only training, but continuous retraining as well, within respective fields/spheres, for self-actualization and potential optimization. 
But somehow, training is rarely accepted as an interesting and challenging activity. 
In most organizations it is dealt with as yet another routine, run of the mill formality that needs to be done only to fulfill job/service requirements. 
5. Public servants need to be trained in a mode and manner, so as to develop and enhance their knowledge and skills and bring about positive attitudinal change in them in order to equip them with capability for better service delivery.
6. It was in this background that a Committee on Training was constituted under the able Chairmanship of Dr. A. Hafeez Pasha, former Federal Minister for Finance and Economic Affairs, Deputy Chairman Planning Commission and former Assistant Secretary General United Nations. 
He was joined by eminent members with long experience in public service. 
The Committee devised its ToR which covered not only pre/in-service and professional training but initial recruitment process of public servants as well. 
7. The Committee has identified systemic issues which need to be addressed to streamline the training regime. 
We believe that a truthful implementation of the recommendations made in this report will go a long way, bringing our training structure and system in line with best international practices in order to meet contemporary challenges. 
8. I must thank Dr. A. Hafeez Pasha and his distinguished associates for their outstanding work in preparing this report. 
I must also appreciate here the work of Mr. Naimatullah Abid, former Director General NIPA, Peshawar for his tireless work as Member/Secretary of the Committee. 
9. We hope the recommendations of the Committee will be considered and implemented in the spirit in which they have been formulated. I look forward to your feedback. 
Yours sincerely,
(Salman Faruqui)

President of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan

Dear------------------------,
Allow me to extend congratulations on your appointment as Secretary General of the United Nations. 
I send my best wishes for your continued wisdom, strength and commitment in performing the important and responsible duties of this position.
2. I am very pleased that your long-standing experience and determined efforts to provide support and care for refugees around the world as well as to mobilize international assistance for the displaced have been highly evaluated and rightly so. 
In the face of the migration crisis, your leaderships will definitely help to bring the international community together for finding a united response to many critical problems of today.
3. The ongoing threat of terrorism, climate change, people in zones of conflict  and forcibly displaced persons, children who are unable to go to school, women exposed to violence, and many other serious challenges require that the United Nations stand strong in its efforts and moral leadership. 
Disrespect for the fundamental principles of the United Nations and international law most painfully affects innocent civilians, especially women and children. 
There is still lack of progress in fully engaging women in political, social and economic processes, ensuring their equal opportunities and rights worldwide.
4. On the other hand, the constructive international dialogue on the 2030. Agenda for sustainable development and the historic success of the Paris Climate Agreement give hope that the international community recognizes our joint responsibility for dealing with today's global challenges. You now have the difficult but very important duty of encouraging-continuously and tirelessly member states to seek compromises and convincing them that common solutions benefit us all.
5. I firmly believe that together we will continue the tradition of cooperation built on trust and respect between ----name of the country--- and the United Nations, which will serve as a solid foundation for our future work during your term in office.
6. I wish you the best of success in your new challenging responsibilities. 
Please accept the assurances of my highest consideration.

Honourable Prime Minister
----name of country-----
-----name of capital------
Dear Prime Minister,
We are writing this letter to express our deepest concerns about proposal to close the Maternity Department at 'A' Hospital which serves people in our constituencies.
2. This move will be very detrimental to local health services. 
It will place unbearable pressure on the other two hospitals (B and C)) in the area. 
In fact both the hospitals do not have adequate number of staff in the Maternity Department. 
The understaffing at B and C Hospitals have put mothers and babies at risk. 
The poor quality care has led to the death of a mother and baby.
3. We have come to know that the closure of Maternity Department at Hospital 'A' is being taken due to non-availability of funds.
4. The area covered by the 'A' Hospital has one of the fastest growing populations in the country. 
In these areas, ten thousands babies were born last year.
5. As a result of new housing projects in the ----name of area---- and change of population in the ---name of area----, birth of babies is growing 500 more each year.
6. The local population strongly oppose the move of closing the Maternity Department at 'A' Hospital and tens of thousands people of our constituencies have signed a petition against it.
7. Ministry for Health has now prepared proposals for regular provision of funds to the 'A' Hospital so that the Maternity Department at this hospital is not closed.
8. We welcome these proposals but request you to intervene in the matter and take positive steps to halt the closure of the Maternity Department so that the local population in our constituencies is not deprived of the health care services which are already under stretched. 
With best wishes.
Yours sincerely,

Dear Prime Minister,
We are writing to you this letter as a matter of urgency to seek a meeting with you. We want the government to clarify its position on the possible construction of a new airport in the ----name of place----
2. We have come to know from the reports in the media that the government proposes to consider the construction of a new airport in or around the ---name of place----.
3. It appears that the public of our constituencies does not support the proposal for the construction of the new airport in ------name of place-------. 
If the proposed airport is constructed in----name of place------, it will have an enormous  effect on the lives of hundreds of thousands of residents living in this wide area and devastate an area of global environmental significance.
4. We strongly urge the government not to proceed with this proposal. Instead, they should consider to utilize fully the capacity of the existing airports in ----name of place---and ----name of palce----.
5. We look forward to meeting with you as soon as possible so that we may discuss this urgent matter.

This report presents a detailed review of the Commission's performance, accomplishments and areas of concern during 2016, as given below: 
II. Performance Highlights
4. Globalization and technological revolution has thrown severe challenges to the traditional recruitment system during the last two decades. 
With more erudite citizenry, extremely vigilant and liberal electronic media, intense accountability of public policy makers through a vibrant judiciary, civil servants are finding themselves under ever keener scrutiny. Ubiquitous use of internet and social media has raised the level of expectations in terms of speed.

This requires adoption of an efficient, transparent and merit-based system of recruitment for the civil services of Pakistan enabling the state to deliver desired public services to the citizens in a most effective and efficient manner. 
While effectively addressing growing challenges, the Federal Public Service Commission maintained trust of the public through its policies of transparency, fairness. impartiality and professionalism during the year under report. 
The statistics on the number of applications, conduct of tests/examinations, interviews and the nominations made during the year show a continued high level of employee engagement across FPSC. An overview of the core functions accomplished by the FPSC is as follows:

The Commission conducted the CSS CE 2016 based on the new syllabi which was one of the important milestones achieved during 2016. 
Under the new scheme marks of many subjects were rationalized and six new optional subjects viz Governance and Public Policy, Criminology, Gender Studies, Environmental Sciences, Anthropology and Town Planning & Urban Management were added to the list.

foreword
Paving the way for the implementation of the national language Urdu in the official, office and judicial spheres of national life is one of the main aims and objectives of the National Language Promotion Institute.
To achieve this goal, the organization has been active since its inception and has been achieving its goals by publishing several books related to office language.
What is the system of government in Pakistan? And at what level what style is prevalent? On this subject, Mr. Jamshed Alam wrote articles which were published in the journal "Ilm wa Fan" for the promotion of national language.
In these articles, the organizational structure of the government at the federal, provincial and district levels, the system of government of the provinces, the relations and procedures between the federation and the provinces were described in detail.
These articles were of importance so it was decided to convert these articles into a book.
When Mr. Jamshed Alam was requested to revise these articles, he repeated the process of amendments, additions and deletions, re-drafting it according to the latest information and including Gilgit-Baltistan.
Mr. Jamshed Alam has a long experience in government service and is intimately familiar with the basic and additional requirements of adapting the office system to the national language.
He fulfilled the lack of material in Urdu on this subject through this book.
His services in making the national language Urdu an official language are commendable.
I am also grateful to Dr. Anjum Hameed and Mr. Shakeel Ahmad Mangaluri for using their skills to bring it into book form.
I am sure that this book will be of interest to civil servants, students of political science and people from other walks of life.

Constitutional background
1. Constitution of the State: Basis of Organizational Structure
A constitution is the basic law of a country that defines the ideals, concepts, basic principles of its internal management and the boundaries of duties and powers between its various departments.
In ancient times, the most important function of the constitution was to determine who should rule the country.
The criteria for assigning the political authority of a country to an individual reflected the emotional attitudes and behavior of the social system of that country.
Whatever the form of the constitution, it used to influence the morals of the people.
Although modern constitutions are more complex, the laws and regulations governing the acquisition and exercise of governmental authority in a state generally cover the basic beliefs, ideas, concepts, and values of a society and its social behaviors in daily life. They represent behavior and manners.
There is a majority of Muslims in Pakistan (97 percent) and the distinguishing feature of Muslims is the belief of Tawheed and the code of life based on the teachings of the last Prophet Muhammad.
In an Islamic society built on the basis of the Book and the Sunnah, without discrimination of color, caste and creed, the protection of basic human rights, direct or indirect involvement of every person from an ordinary citizen to the President of the State in the management of the government. And the sense of accountability, the rule of justice and the high values of unity of thought are fostered.
According to democratic principles, the Constitution of Pakistan is the expression of the wishes of the majority living in this country.
Allama Muhammad Iqbal and Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah have given a clear indication of these aspirations in their various sermons.
Allama Muhammad Iqbal in his famous sermon at Allahabad (1930) said in order to improve the separate existence of Muslims in the subcontinent and their social, economic and political conditions:
"After a long and deep study of Islamic law, I have come to the conclusion that if this law is well understood and implemented, every person is guaranteed at least the right to livelihood, but the implementation and development of Shariat is a free Muslim. It is not possible in this country without the state.
Quaid-e-Azam explained the concept of Pakistan several times during the Pakistan Movement and after the establishment of Pakistan. You said:
"Muslims demand Pakistan, where they can rule according to their own code of life, their own cultural development, their own traditions and Islamic law."
(Meeting of Sarhad Muslim League, held in Peshawar on November 21, 1945)
"Every Muslim knows that the Quranic teachings are not limited to worship and ethics, but the Holy Quran is the religion, faith and law of life for Muslims.
That is, it is a collection of religious, social, commercial, cultural, military and penal rules.
Our Messenger, may God bless him and grant him peace, has ordered us to study it carefully so that it leads to individual and collective guidance of Muslims.
The Quaid-e-Azam while explaining his motto after the establishment of Pakistan said:
"Our aim was to create a state where we can live as free human beings, flourish in the light of our civilization and where the Islamic concept of social justice has a chance to flourish." .
(Address to the officers of the Government of Pakistan, October 1947)
2. The Islamic Basis of the Constitution of Pakistan
(1) Objectives of the Resolution: After the establishment of Pakistan, when the constitution of this independent state was being drawn up, in March 1949, on the motion of Mr. Liaquat Ali Khan, the Prime Minister of Pakistan, the Constituent Assembly passed a resolution on March 12, 1949, which It is known as Resolution of Objectives.
In this resolution, the aims and objectives of the future constitution have been described.
This resolution has been included in the preamble of the Constitution of Pakistan.
It is clearly declared in it.
"That Allah Ta'ala is the absolute ruler of the entire universe without participation, and that the people of Pakistan will use the authority and authority within the limits set by Allah is a sacred trust; It is the intention of the people of Pakistan to establish a system in which the State shall exercise its powers and sovereignty through elected representatives of the people; The principles of democracy, freedom, equality, tolerance and social justice, as interpreted by Islam, will be fully implemented in the state; And Muslims will be enabled in individual and collective spheres of action to correct their lives in accordance with Islamic teachings as determined in the Holy Qur'an and the Sunnah of the Prophet ﷺ.
(2) State religion: According to the above clear declaration, it is written in Article 2 of the Constitution that Islam shall be the state religion of Pakistan.
3. Federal nature of the Constitution of Pakistan
In the preamble of the constitution, it is declared that the territories in this kingdom which are currently included or merged in Pakistan and such other territories which will be included or merged in Pakistan later will form a federation in which the units will have their powers and sovereignty. but with such limitations and restrictions as may be prescribed, shall be sovereign.
Federalism: It is a way of creating a unified structure of a state so that powers can be divided between the central and regional governments in such a way that each government is independent in a certain area.
The territory of a federal state is divided into units (eg states, cantons, provinces, republics).
These units are often of distinctive importance as geo-civilizational or historical units.
Many government agencies are established at both the national and regional (provincial in Pakistan) levels.
Both types of governments effectively control the same territory and population.
Thus the citizens of a federal state belong to two political communities at the same time.
Constitutionally (in Pakistan) with respect to the duties assigned to the provincial level government, there is a specific provincial community with its own common interests for citizens permanently residing in a province; Regarding the duties assigned to the federal government, the entire nation of Pakistan is one community and they have common interests with regard to the entire country.
In a true federal state, both levels of government derive their powers directly from the constitution and one government cannot override the jurisdiction of the other.
In the politics of a federal state, the balance of power between the two levels of government and the balance of loyalty of citizens between their country and territory play an active and dynamic role.
Otherwise, the centralist forces may become strong enough to negate the autonomy of the provincial government, while the pro-devolution forces may work to break up the country itself.
Therefore, for a federal state to survive, it is essential that independent political forces exist to support and back up all levels of government.
4. Fundamental Rights in the Constitution: A Guide to Legislation
Fundamental rights have been given utmost importance in the Constitution of Pakistan.
A law that is inconsistent with fundamental rights can be declared null and void.
The Majlis-e-Shura has been mandated that no law can be made contrary to the fundamental rights except for the exceptions mentioned in the constitution.
These fundamental rights within the ambit of law are as follows:
(1) Personal Security: No person shall be deprived of life or liberty except as permitted by law.
(2)	 Protection from Arrest and Detention: No person who has been arrested shall be detained without being informed as soon as possible of the reasons for the arrest, nor shall he be allowed to consult any legal person of his choice and This will deprive the right to offer cleaning.
The arrested/detained person shall be produced before a Magistrate within 24 hours.
(3)	Prohibition of slavery and forced labour
(4)	Protection from punishment by effective ex post facto law
(5)	Protection against double punishment and self-incrimination
(6)	Protection of self-respect and dignity
(7)	Freedom of movement etc
(8)	Freedom of assembly
(9)	Freedom of association
(10) Freedom of trade, business and profession

(19) Every citizen is protected against discrimination in employment.
(20) Every citizen has the right to promote his own language, script and culture and to establish institutions for the same.
5. Policy principles to guide institutions of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan
Incorporation of policy principles into constitutions began with the Constitution of Spain.
In 1937, the principles of the policy were also included in the constitution of Ireland.
These principles were also included in the Constitution of India. The principles of the policy were also defined in the previous constitutions of Pakistan.
In fact, the practice of including the principles of policy in the constitution is necessary for a new political system, the reason being that within any new system, the achievement of multiple objectives is not immediately possible, but for this, the conditions must first be favorable. It is necessary .
Principles of policy indicate the objectives and basic principles with which the business of the state will be conducted.
All the institutions of the state formulate their policies in the light of these objectives.
These principles are also included in the Constitution of Pakistan (1973).
These principles provide a blueprint for determining future paths.
These principles are general in nature and their violation cannot be challenged in court.
As these principles reflect the spirit and mood of the Constitution, courts cannot ignore them while interpreting the Articles of the Constitution.
In the words of former Law Minister and prominent intellectual Mr. AK Brohi (deceased), their position is the manual of the country's government. They mark the basic ideas of the country's policy which the government and legislature have to implement.
It is the responsibility of every institution and authority of the state to follow these principles of the policy while performing their duties.
However, the implementation of these principles is dependent on the availability of resources for this purpose.
Implementation Report: Every year the President on the affairs of the Federation and the Governor of each province on the affairs of his province shall prepare a report on the implementation and compliance of the principles of the policy. The President will submit a report to the National Assembly and the Governor to the Provincial Assembly.
No action or the validity of any law shall be challenged on the ground that it is not in accordance with the principles of policy nor shall any action be maintainable against the State, any agency of the State or any person on that ground.
The policy principles to guide the State institutions will be as follows:
(1)	Islamic Way of Life: Steps will be taken to enable the Muslims of Pakistan, individually and collectively, to organize their lives in accordance with the basic principles and fundamental concepts of Islam and to provide them with facilities that will enable them to read the Qur'an.

The actual implementation of policy-making principles depends largely on an effective and informed public opinion.
If the national mass media and the conscious section of the people are interested in the implementation of these theoretical principles of the constitution, then these principles can have the same status as the constitutional traditions in the British system.
The implementation of these customs is also effective and due to the conscious public opinion.

A well organized and active system of intelligence and espionage was established.
Based on this system, the king received daily information from every part of his empire.
Abbas Sardani, the author of Tarikh Shershahi, has written:
"During the reign of Sher Shah, travelers and wayfarers were freed from the trouble of guarding their belongings and had no fear of being stranded in the middle of the desert.
At night, they used to stay fearlessly anywhere in the desert or the population.
They would leave their cattle in the open field and leave the mules to graze.
They sleep fearlessly as if it were their own home.
Landlords used to protect their equipment so that they would not be harmed and they (landlords) would not be arrested for it.
In the era of Shershahi, even an old woman could travel fearlessly with a basket full of gold ornaments on her head and no thief or robber could come near her for fear of severe punishment from Shershah. "
The reign of Sher Shah Suri

It is a matter of immense honour for me to receive committee reports prepared under your able guidance on the directions of the Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan on very pertinent and core issues pertaining "Maladministration in Police Department" and "Systematic Failures in the Administration of Prisons." 
The Honourable Court's decision to entrust your good office for such significant task is a reflection of the confidence which the Honourable Court has in your department. 
I would take this opportunity to appreciate the efforts of both committees on comprehensive and well-researched work. 
The committee probed pertinent issues from all relevant angles and has come up with a comprehensive way ahead to eradicate the weaknesses in the existing administration of Police and Prisons.
Although the committee has endeavored to unearth all possible issues in respective domains, however few suggestions are being made for your kind consideration to add value to the research work. 
The same are enclosed.
I hope you will find my view point useful and a value addition to a work, already very well done.

No.1(10)HWM/2016 May 17, 2016
Honorable Mr. Chief justice, 
It was providential that Your Honour, as the Chief Justice of this not infrequently beleaguered country, took notice of the inhuman plight of the thousands of prison inmates in Pakistan and directed the Office of the Wafaqi Mohtasib (Federal Ombudsman) of Pakistan to form standing committee/s and inspection team/s to examine the systemic failures in the administrations of the criminal justice system and the prisons in particular and make recommendations to rectify such failures and set good administration standards that, if breached, would be deemed to be maladministration. 
I have used the word providential because I believe that had the Honourable Supreme Court not taken suo moto notice of the hapless poor, the wheels of much needed reforms would not have moved and the undeserved miseries inflicted on these thousands of men, women and children would have continued unchecked. 
By directing us to do that, the Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan has earned the gratitude of the people and has also set a healthy precedence of drawing the attention of the Executive to systemic failures that heap undue sufferings and inflict miseries on the citizens.
Sir, drawing inspiration from your direction, this Office and members of the National Committee on Prisons have spared no effort to visit, inspect, study and analyse the situation as it exists in various prisons of the country. 
Headed by the distinguished Senator(R), Mr. S.M. Zafar, former President of Human Rights Society of Pakistan and Minister for Law and Justice, the Committee included eminent educationists, serving and retired civil servants and prominent civil society activists. 
What unfolded before them is too horrifying to describe. 
To put it mildly, while there is noticeable improvement, thanks due to serious efforts by the Inspectors General of Prisons and some of their colleagues in some of the prisons, the conditions continue to be grossly inhuman. 
But instead of dampening, it, in fact only ignited the zeal and the passion of the members to go ahead with the mission that they had accepted to carry forward. 
They took exceptional pain and stress to reach to the bottom of the malaise, identify the systemic failures and bring forward a set of recommendations that are pragmatic and practicable. 
In dong so, they have earned the admiration of us all.
3. It is, thus, with a sense of satisfaction and indeed pride in the extraordinary efforts of the Committee that I take this opportunity to present to you its comprehensive report. 
I do so in the belief that their efforts will lead to the setting up of systems and principles that will ensure that the prison inmates in Pakistan are treated humanely and justly, specially the women and children.
Sincerely,
(M. Salman Faruqui)

Assalam-o-Alaikum
I am pleased to acknowledge the receipt of Ombudsman's Report of the National Committee on Prisons constituted by the Federal Ombudsman of Pakistan in pursuance of the orders of the Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan. 
2. The Committee has carried out invaluable work to identify the perennial problems existing in our prison system. The report charts a clear way that promises to usher the much needed reform, particularly for the good of incarcerated women and juveniles. 
3. The prisons can play an important role in reformation of the inmates to equip them with elementary/better education and skills during their internment or sentence and prepare them to become useful citizens upon returning to the society. This area has been paid little attention in the past. 
4. The Committee's report with a set of recommendations to redress this situation is an important step that deserves due recognition and necessary follow up. 
With best wishes and warm regards.
Yours sincerely,
(Admiral Muhammad Zakaullah Khan)

My dear 
Rule 4 8(1) of the Public Procurement Rules, 200 4unambiguously provides that the procuring agency shall constitute a committee comprising odd number of persons, with proper powers and authorizations to address the complaints of bidders that may occur prior to entry into force of the procurement contract. 
The redress process and further recourse is laid down in Rule 4 8(2), (3), (4) & (5).

Subject: Redress of Grievances Redressal And Principal Accounting Officers
My dear Secretary, 
Pivotal position of Principal Accounting Officer in our system of governance needs no underscoring nor can the importance of transparency in procurement process be minimized. 
Part and parcel of transparency is the mechanism to redress grievance. 
2. PPRA, has sufficiently brought out the rule position of grievance handling along with the requirement to form Grievance Redressal Committees. 
This request did not meet a resounding response; the result can be viewed at www.ppra.org.pk where Committees stand uploaded for the benefit of aggrieved bidders and the public to meet the tenets of transparency. 
3. To strengthen the mechanism as provided under Rule 4 8of Public Procurement Rules 2004, the Principal Accounting Officer as a next logical step should conduct an administrative review on the findings of complaint and take action in accordance with conduct rules in the event of unfair and non-transparent procurement process. 
The decision of administrative review shall be communicated to PPRA, the aggrieved bidder and the procuring entity prior to the award of contract without retarding the procurement process. 
4. The intent is to complete the first tier Grievance Redressal mechanism. 
The second tier is under active deliberation.

My dear Secretary, 
It has been observed that in many cases/procuring agencies prefer registration of firms by charging exorbitant registration feel processing fee and few other charges instead of adhering to Rules 1 5& 1 6of Public Procurement Rules, 2004. 
Such practices are in conflict with the basic objective of holding healthy competition among the suppliers/contractors or service providers. 
Public Procurement Rules, 200 4allow procuring agencies to charge price of pre qualification/bidding documents only to cover costs of printing. 
2. All the organizations/ autonomous bodies under the administrative control of your Ministry may be advised to refrain from such practices and follow Public Procurement Rules, 200 4in letter and spirit.

Preparation of Annual Procurement Plan by every procuring agency of the Federal Government and its uploading on the PPRA website and the procuring agency's own website (if any) is mandatory, in terms of Rule  8&  9of the Public Procurement Rules 2004. 
Failure to do so straightaway leads to mis-procurement which cannot be condoned either under the PPRA Ordinance, 200 2or any other law of the land. 
2. Inspite of the above clear cut mandatory requirements of the Rules, most of the procurement agencies neither prepare their Annual Procurement Plans nor upload them on the PPRA website before start of actual procurement. 
Please note that any procurement without a publicized procurement plan on the PPRA website is a mis- procurement, under the Rules. 
3. Since the new financial year is going to start w.e.f. 01-07-2014, all procuring agencies are requested to prepare and upload their respective plans on the PPRA's website on the enclosed proforma before initiating the actual procurements. 
From July 2014, the procurement advertisements of the defaulting organizations will be marked by the Authority as violation of the Rules 8,  9of the Public Procurement Rules, 200 4and conveyed to the respective procuring agencies.

Dear Salman Faruqui,
Reference your letter of 31st October, 201 6and the report on Government procurement system. The reason for answering with some delay is the time consumed for going through the entire report.
During my practice I had to defend some of the cases of procurement by the Government.
Through the study thereof, the observations by the judges during the hearing and in the final judgment, I was hoping that the procedure and the system of Government procurements will be properly re-framed. 
The report, therefore, was a good news to me that some serious efforts have been made in this regard which may improve the task for the Standing Committee and the Senate on this subject. 
However, what has irritated me in the past, through the experience inside and outside the Government, is that the reports are received as welcome by the governments and are ignored similarly by the swift hands sending them to incompetent bureaucratic committees. 
So, I may suggest that after sending a report like this one and others, the Ombudsman office under your guidance may ensure that the recommendations have been acted upon and implemented. 
Otherwise your and our efforts will only add to dustbin and our frustration. 
There must be a system by which we can inquire from the government, after reasonable time, the result of receiving the report. 
Yours sincerely,
(Senator Dr. S.M. Zafar)

Dear Salman Faruqui Sahib,
It is with deep gratitude that I received your letter of 13th October 201 6along with a copy of 'Federal Ombudsman Report on Government Procurement System to Address Maladministration and Ensure Transparency'. 
In recognition of economic challenges facing our country, implementation of the committee's recommendations across the public domain would bring in cost efficiencies, while maximizing the operational as well as administrative utility of our scarce budget. 
The contents of the report are being disseminated within Pakistan Navy for guidance and education of concerned staff. 
2. Pakistan Navy has always endeavoured to extract best value for the limited budget allocated by MoD within the bounds of PPRA and procurement rules promulgated by MoDP/DGDP. 
A number of new initiatives have been taken to streamline the procurement process in PN. 
These include prioritization of naval staff requirements, transparent bidding process and institution of Standing Appeals Committee to redress legitimate grievances of suppliers. 
Pakistan Navy has also setup procurement Management System for electronic processing of contractual activities. 
3. I thank you and extend our full support towards your noble pursuits.
With profound regards

I would like to extend my gratitude to you for sharing with us the "Federal, Ombudsman report on Government procurement system to address maladministration and ensure transparency''
The report shows indelible mark of your leadership. Transparency is a key principle for good governance and national development. 
It increases predictability and enhances confidence in institutions on the basis of adequate legislation and the rule of law. 
If we can address systemic weaknesses through financial transparency and fairness in procurement of goods and services, heavy chunks of public resources would be saved and spent on development projects. 
Rather than dealing with routine matters, the report effectively deals with the causes of malpractices in government departments in procurement of goods and services.
I  hope the Government of Pakistan would take full advantage of the report's valuale recommendations.

Dear Mr. M. Salman Faruqui,
I personally feel honored and grateful to you, for timely sharing with us, this excellent analysis on public procurement. 
The balanced and in-depth analysis on the whole range of procurement issues alongwith recommendations speaks volumes about the level of efforts invested by the team members. 
As a leading public sector institution, SBP is strictly complying with Public Procurement Rules issued by the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority; however, I am confident that the quality content of this report would be of great help to further strengthen the procurement policy and procedures of our organization. It will also help the legislature and policy makers in making the required changes that will boister and enhance "value for money" procurements, while maintaining transparency in the procurement process.

2. It is indeed impressive to note that under your esteemed leadership, the office of Federal Ombudsman is remarkably contributing towards provision of speedy and inexpensive justice to common man of Pakistan.
I sincerely congratulate you and your team for tremendous achievements made over the years in complaint redressal. With your passion, commitment and leadership, I am confident that the institution of Wafaqi Mohtasib would continue to excel. It gives me immense pleasure to relate with your objective of providing speedy and fair justice to masses which principally is an essential pillar of Financial Consumer Protection, one of the top priority areas for State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).
An impartial and efficient external dispute resolution forum, in case of banking sector, is the office of Banking Mohtasib Pakistan (BMP).
We in SBP are working to enhance coordination and cooperation with the BMP to make it a preferred redressal choice of banking customers so that SBP could focus on supervision of conduct of the banks and strengthen its regulatory regime.
I would like to take this opportunity to call your attention to the following concerns that have emerged as a result of Federal Ombudsman Institutional Reform Act. 2013.


Banking Consumer is legally compelled to give a 45 day's notice to bank before filing a complaint with BMP which is antagonistic to the concept of speedy justice specially in banking industry where grievances require immediate action. 
Resultantly, SBP is coerced to run a parallel redressal forum which handled 643 4complaints in FY14-1 5as compared to 4506 complaints dealt at BMP.
There appears an overlap of jurisdiction between Wafaqi/Provincial Ombudsmen and BMP regarding banking disputes where the later have power to entertain complaints against both public as well as private banks. 
Thus, there is a need to formulate a working mechanism amongst the Ombudsmen to eradicate duplication of work.
I extend my full support and cooperation to further strengthen the institution of Wafaqi Mohtasib and achieve its objectives.

My dear Secretary,
It has been emphasized from time to time that due attention should be paid to the collection and preservation of official records, publications and other materials as archives or public documents and their optimum utilization for official purposes, research and study ensured. 
A copy of the President's latest directive (No.38 9of 1985) on the subject is enclosed. 
2.	It is generally felt that the prescribed procedures governing declassification of official records are not being followed, leading often to their non-transmittal to archives repositories concerned and their consequential inaccessibility for study and research by scholars and others. 
It is accordingly requested that the Ministries/Divisions of the Federal Government and the various Departments of the Provincial Governments should arrange, at designated points, to make available to interested people at least unclassified printed official materials, reports, memoranda and documents in their custody. 
This should to some extent mitigate public grievance. 
3. You are, therefore, requested to make necessary arrangements for the purpose and publicize them suitably.
Yours sincerely,

My dear,
A case has come to notice where a delegation had not been provided with a clear brief and the delegates also, on their part, had not undertaken to apprise themselves of the guidelines framed and issued by the Government regarding their conduct and behaviour abroad. 
The result was that, owing to their ignorance of rules and procedures, the delegation signed a document in a foreign country without proper authorization which could place the Government of Pakistan in an embarrassing situation. 
2. The matter was brought to notice of the President who has been pleased to direct that attention of all Ministries/Divisions and the Provincial Governments should be drawn to the requirement of briefing all delegations going abroad. 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs had issued a booklet called "Guidance for Pakistan delegations to International Conferences, Meetings etc.," in 197 2which is being re-circulated separately to all concerned for strict observance. However an extract from Para 2 3thereof is enclosed for your immediate reference.
3. You are accordingly requested to kindly note the above directions of the President and to ensure that all delegations proceeding abroad are properly briefed and the instructions issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in this behalf strictly observed. 
4. In the meantime kindly acknowledge receipt.

Sometimes the brief given by the sponsoring Ministry contains guidelines on major policy issues. In case issues arise which are not covered by the brief, ask for time to enable you to obtain instructions from home. 
It is essential to remember that you should not take a decision on your own initiative which may involve a commitment on the part of your Government against its policies".

Dear Salman,
Thank you so much for your letter dated 1 8February 2015. Please accept my compliments for the quick and effective relief provided to the public during your tenure.
The initiative for recourse to the Alternative Dispute Resolution is long overdue. 
Our judicial system is the weakest part of the British legacy that has been concerned more with law than justice. 
It has simply failed to perform the service it was expected.
As reforming the judicial system would be long and difficult process, the only feasible recourse is ADR. 
I wish you success in this initiative.

Annexure
Recommendations made by the subcommitee
Item. No. 5
The Sub-Committee considered this issue and felt that detailed instructions for carrying out regular and systematic inspections by Deputy Secretary and Joint Secretary already existed in the Secretariat Instructions.
Similar instructions to carry out inspections in Attached Departments were circulated by the Establishment Division to all Ministries/Divisions.
It was, however, noted that in actual practice inspections were not carried out at regular intervals.
Views expressed by two Provincial Governments also confirmed that inspections were not being regularly carried out in various organizations in the Provinces.
This was primarily due to the reason that most of the time of the officers responsible for carrying out inspections was being consumed daily in solving matters like enforcing the price level of essential commodities, protocol, checking of vehicles etc.
In certain cases, the Senior Officers who did not find time for inspection, deputed their subordinates to carry out inspection on their behalf.
Moreover, the multiplicity of institutional arrangements to carry inspection e.g., Governor's Inspection Team, the Provincial Vigilance Commission, Divisional Vigilance Committee, and District Vigilance Committee etc., may create confusion with consequential blurring of the responsibility of each institution.
The Committee was also informed of the cumbersome procedure for inspection, which usually render inspections more difficult and time consuming.
After discussion, the Sub-Committee decided to make the following recommendations:
-
(i) All Secretaries incharge of the Ministries/Divisions, should be requested to ensure that instructions about inspection, as embodied in the Secretariat Instructions were strictly followed.
For this purpose the Joint Secretary (Admn.) in each Ministry/ Division should be made responsible to ensure compliance of the provisions of the Secretariat Instructions.
(ii) The need to reduce the number of inspecting agencies to make the system more effective and economical may be considered.
(iii) The proformae for inspection should be simplified so as to include only selected items to be inspected by each inspecting officer.
(iv) The line and sphere of responsibility for inspection and supervision should be very clear and precise.
