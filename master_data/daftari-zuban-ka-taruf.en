Annexure
Recommendations made by the subcommitee
Item. No. 5
The Sub-Committee considered this issue and felt that detailed instructions for carrying out regular and systematic inspections by Deputy Secretary and Joint Secretary already existed in the Secretariat Instructions.
Similar instructions to carry out inspections in Attached Departments were circulated by the Establishment Division to all Ministries/Divisions.
It was, however, noted that in actual practice inspections were not carried out at regular intervals.
Views expressed by two Provincial Governments also confirmed that inspections were not being regularly carried out in various organizations in the Provinces.
This was primarily due to the reason that most of the time of the officers responsible for carrying out inspections was being consumed daily in solving matters like enforcing the price level of essential commodities, protocol, checking of vehicles etc.
In certain cases, the Senior Officers who did not find time for inspection, deputed their subordinates to carry out inspection on their behalf.
Moreover, the multiplicity of institutional arrangements to carry inspection e.g., Governor's Inspection Team, the Provincial Vigilance Commission, Divisional Vigilance Committee, and District Vigilance Committee etc., may create confusion with consequential blurring of the responsibility of each institution.
The Committee was also informed of the cumbersome procedure for inspection, which usually render inspections more difficult and time consuming.
After discussion, the Sub-Committee decided to make the following recommendations:-
(i) All Secretaries incharge of the Ministries/Divisions, should be requested to ensure that instructions about inspection, as embodied in the Secretariat Instructions were strictly followed.
For this purpose the Joint Secretary (Admn.) in each Ministry/ Division should be made responsible to ensure compliance of the provisions of the Secretariat Instructions.
(ii) The need to reduce the number of inspecting agencies to make the system more effective and economical may be considered.
(iii) The proformae for inspection should be simplified so as to include only selected items to be inspected by each inspecting officer.
(iv) The line and sphere of responsibility for inspection and supervision should be very clear and precise.

Subject: Introduction of Urdu as the Official Language.
My dear
Kindly refer to the Presidential Directive No. 228 of 1984 on the subject noted above.
In this connection, I would like to state that about 1800 officers of various Ministries/Divisions have by now completed Daftri Urdu Course being conducted by the Allama Iqbal Open University, Besides, the first course in Urdu shorthand/typing would conclude by the end of April, 1985.
It appears to be necessary that the expertise and technical skill acquired by the trained officers/officials should not only be retained but it should also be improved.
Following instructions are accordingly issued for compliance in view of the objective indicated above:-
(1) Officers should dispose a part of their official work in Urdu so that stenographers/typists who have received training in Urdu shorthand and typing continue their practice and improve their recently acquired skill.
Every officer is expected to assess as to how much work he can do in Urdu.
The scope of work in Urdu should gradually expand.
(2) Brief noting on files may be done in Urdu to the extent possible.
(3) Correspondence with the various officials in scale (1-4) e.g. Sweeper, Farash, Naib Qasid, Jamadar, Driver etc. may be done in Urdu.
(4) Letters received in Urdu may be diarized in Urdu and replies thereof should also be given in Urdu.
In addition, correspondence with the public should be done in Urdu.

(5) Office orders/internal instructions should be issued in Urdu.
Minutes of the internal meetings should be recorded in Urdu.
(6) Brief orders on fresh receipts e.g. "Please put up immediately"; "Please put up with relevant records" etc. may be recorded and signed in Urdu. 
(7) Brief reminders should be issued in Urdu to the extent possible.
(8) Name plates of officers/officials should be displayed in Urdu.
(9) All the work in General Section should be done in Urdu and demand for various items e.g. stationery etc. should be sent to the General Section in Urdu.
(10) Leave application should be submitted in Urdu.
(11) One-third of the stenographers/typists to be recruited in future should have the required skill in both the languages.
(12) Typewriters to be purchased in future should include Urdu typewriters on the basis of requirements.
(13) Stationery for official use may be printed in Urdu.
2. Listed above are some initial steps.
With increase in the number of trained officials, the volume of work disposed of in Urdu is expected to increase.
In some offices Urdu is extensively used prior to issue of these instructions. 
It should be continued and increased as far as possible.
You are requested to furnish a compliance report on the implementation of these instructions within three months.
Yours Sincerely,

Examples of demarche
In July 1914, a few days before World War I began, Australia and Russia exchanged demarches
In september 1996, US President Clinton issued a demarche to Iraqi President Saddam Husain when intelligence reports showed troops massing along the border of Kurd communities.
On August 30, 1999, Pakistan issued a demarche to India demanding that the Government of India should pay compensation for the loss of a Pakistani aircraft and the lives of the sixteen personnel on board when one of its military planes was shot down.
On 15 September, 2014 the Ell, its 2 8Member States and the governments of the United States, Australia, Brazil, Israel, New Zealand, Mexico and Monaco declared their opposition to the practice of the Icelandic government that still permits commercial whaling, in particular the hunting of fin whales and the subsequent trading of fin whale products. 
The Eu's Ambassador to Iceland, Matthias Brinkmann, alongwith the diplomatic representatives of the United States, France, Germany and the UK delivered a demarche to this effect to the Icelandic government.
The Ambassador also pointed out that public opinion in the countries that are Iceland's main trading partners is very much against the practice of whaling. 
This evidenced by the public pressure put on companies around the world to boycott Icelandic goods, not to mention the pressure that voters and various organisations put on their politicians, encouraging them to send Iceland an increasingly stronger message.
Text of the Demarche
Joint Demarche by the European Union, its member states and the Governments of the United States of America, Australia, Brazil, Israel, Mexico and New Zealand.
We, the European Union and its Member States and the Governments of the United States of America, Australia, Brazil, Israel and New Zealand, wish to express our strong opposition to Iceland's continuing and increased commercial harvest of whales, particularly fin whales and to its ongoing international trade in whale-products.
We encourage the Government of Iceland to adhere to the internationally agreed moratorium on commercial whaling and to re-examine the decision to continue to issue fin and minke whale quotas.
We also object to Iceland's international trade in whale products
In summary, we once again call upon Iceland to respect the IWC's* global moratorium and end its commercial whaling and international trade in whale products.
