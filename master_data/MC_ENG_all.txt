Rawalpindi, the 26th February, 1985
Khalid Umer Farooqi
Additional Secretary,
Additional Secretary,
Tele. 632219
Subject: Introduction of Urdu as the Official Language.
My dear
Kindly refer to the Presidential Directive No. 228 of 1984 on the subject noted above.
In this connection, I would like to state that about 1800 officers of various Ministries/Divisions have by now completed Daftri Urdu Course being conducted by the Allama Iqbal Open University, Besides, the first course in Urdu shorthand/typing would conclude by the end of April, 1985.
It appears to be necessary that the expertise and technical skill acquired by the trained officers/officials should not only be retained but it should also be improved.
Following instructions are accordingly issued for compliance in view of the objective indicated above:-
(1) Officers should dispose a part of their official work in Urdu so that stenographers/typists who have received training in Urdu shorthand and typing continue their practice and improve their recently acquired skill.
Every officer is expected to assess as to how much work he can do in Urdu.
The scope of work in Urdu should gradually expand.
(2) Brief noting on files may be done in Urdu to the extent possible.
(3) Correspondence with the various officials in scale (1-4) e.g. Sweeper, Farash, Naib Qasid, Jamadar, Driver etc. may be done in Urdu.
(4) Letters received in Urdu may be diarized in Urdu and replies thereof should also be given in Urdu.
In addition, correspondence with the public should be done in Urdu.

(5) Office orders/internal instructions should be issued in Urdu.
Minutes of the internal meetings should be recorded in Urdu.
(6) Brief orders on fresh receipts e.g. "Please put up immediately"; "Please put up with relevant records" etc. may be recorded and signed in Urdu. 
(7) Brief reminders should be issued in Urdu to the extent possible.
(8) Name plates of officers/officials should be displayed in Urdu.
(9) All the work in General Section should be done in Urdu and demand for various items e.g. stationery etc. should be sent to the General Section in Urdu.
(10) Leave application should be submitted in Urdu.
(11) One-third of the stenographers/typists to be recruited in future should have the required skill in both the languages.
(12) Typewriters to be purchased in future should include Urdu typewriters on the basis of requirements.
(13) Stationery for official use may be printed in Urdu.
2. Listed above are some initial steps.
With increase in the number of trained officials, the volume of work disposed of in Urdu is expected to increase.
In some offices Urdu is extensively used prior to issue of these instructions. 
It should be continued and increased as far as possible.
You are requested to furnish a compliance report on the implementation of these instructions within three months.
Yours Sincerely,
(K.U. FARUQUI)
