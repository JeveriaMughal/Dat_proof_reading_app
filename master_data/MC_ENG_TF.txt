May Allah bless you with honourable success
You will kindly recall that during 1979 printing of electoral rolls was arranged by the Printing Corporation of Pakistan through private printers all over the Country
However it is understood that during the last about 31/2 years only 344 cases have so far been settled out of a total number of 512 cases
In this connection Election Commission has repeatedly reminded the Printing Corporation of Pakistan to expedite the refunding of the security deposits but to no purpose
I shall be obliged If you kindly ensure that the outstanding security deposits are refunded to the printers concerned without further delay
Any further delay in making the refund of security deposit is likely to destroy the image of the Election Commission and encourage an attitude of no cooperation towards it for the execution of any of its future jobs
Please refer to the correspondence resting with this office telegram No dated and subsequent telegraphic reminders of even number dated and Regarding reprinting of damaged pages of electoral rolls of Larkana district
All arrangements for the reprinting having thus been finalized it is strange to note that progress of printing is not being intimated to this office for onward transmission to Election Commission of Pakistan which has asked for early submission thereof
I shall be grateful if you would kindly arrange to intimate the latest position of printing so that Election commission of Pakistan may be informed accordingly

In this connection I would like to add that a number of private printers were engaged for the printing of Electoral Rolls in 1979 subject to a security deposit equal to 5% of the value of work allotted to them by the PCP
Although the work relating to the printing of electoral rolls was completed in September 20 the question of refund of security deposits remains outstanding and the printers concerned are clamouring for refund
In all fairness the PCP instead of waiting for the printers formal requests should have either asked the printers concerned to make a formal request for the refund of Security Deposits or itself taken the initiative to refund the deposits
I shall therefore be obliged if you will kindly take personal interest in this case and ensure that all the pending cases are finalized without further loss of time

He has stated that the socioeconomic condition of his family recorded persistently increasing miseries particularly due to the events of December 1971
His family had to leave real property worth Rs 15 to 20 lacs without any compensation in former E Pakistan
He also failed to notice that the cheque furnished by M/s Which was received alongwith the Tender had expired by the time the sale agreement was concluded on… Between the said Contractor and the Department
As is apparent from para the three tenderers furnished earnest money in the form of cheques while the fourth tendered submitted the Tender with out any earnest money The question for consideration here is / are responsible for it
This question in my opinion can be answered by perusing the relevant clause of the sale agreement approved by the Director General on going through it I find that clauses 14 simply spell out the term & condition of the sale agreement between the Department

4 WHEREAS the competent Authority is of the opinion that the aforesaid irregularities if established to have been committed by you would call for a penalty of dismissal from service specified in rule 4(b) of the rules ibid
The Departmental Representative when questioned on this point stated that despise efforts to obtain a photo copy of the said letter he Embassy of Pakistan… And the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were not able to supply the same
He did not remember as to who had delivered the envelope to him Mr Section Officer or in Naib Qasid
Since he remained unauthorisedly absent from duty and did not resume duty despite refusal notice his action amounted to wilful disobedience of the Government orders and treated as gross misconduct
This document was neither made available by the Administration nor by Assistant Chief despite notice served to them
In the written reply to the charge sheet submitted by Mr under Rule 6(2) of the Government Servant (Efficiency and Discipline ) Rule 1973 the accused has not made any defence
There is case of wilful disobedience of the Government orders and constitutes a gross misconduct thus invoking the imposition of one of the major penal ties specified in Rule 4(b) of the Government Servant (Efficiency and Discipline) Rules1973
Thus he failed to obtain the required security deposit from the Contractor before concluding the sale Agreement
I accordance with clause 5 in case of violation of any of the terms and condition of the contract the contractor was made liable for the payment of loss as fixed by the Department

He was directed to report for duty immediately failing which necessary disciplinary action would be taken against him

Reason for dismissed Misconduct
Having gone through the records of the case and having appreciated the evidence on file I record my findings on the charges in the forth coming paragraphs
The accused officer it appears was fully conscious of the existing instructions of the use of diplomatic bag and as such he has tried to fall back upon a common practice said to be in vogue in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs whereby diplomats stationed
I reproduce the relevant paras of the accuse officer s admissions from his replies to the charge sheet and subsequent written defence
In fact it was an informal letter to help some one in a certain matte in respectable limits not with the intention to help him out of the way
The truth is that in writing the letter under reference I only allowed myself to be swayed by a feeling to help some body in a seemingly genuine and innocent situation without the slightest idea of its implication
To sum up the whole discussion I conclude that charges III to VI have been proved against the accused officer while dealing the case the Authorized Officer may be pleased to consider Para 4 of the accused Officer s reply to the Chargesheet wherein he ha

The exact nature of the letter could have been determined by examining the original letter purported to have been written by the accused officer but the said letter has neither been produced by the defence
It has been further alleged that the accused officer allotted a fictitious number to the said letter viz… in an attempt to tinge it with an official colour
Mr Assistant deposed that the entries against the date appearing in the Peon Book of the Projects Cell Were in his handwriting
Accordingly he allotted number on the envelope The number was imaginary having no relevance to the Diary Register He allotted this number as the R & I Section would not accept the letter
Charge NoII therefore has also not been proved against the accused officer
The accused officer has not been able to substantiate this contention by any evidence
It transpires from records that during an inquiry against immigration staff of FIA an applicant had produced a photo copy of letter No… dated… issued by the Consulate General of Pakistan …
It has been alleged that the accused officer illegally supplied a copy of the said letter to some outsider without bringing its contents to the notice of his superior officers and without prior administrative approval
it further transpires that the accused officer wanted this official communication for helping a third person who in turn could use this official communication as a price of evidence probably to rebut a plea of alibi which my have been a subject matter of

While in my opinion this fact was certainly over looked by the accuse officer but the other officers/officials who handled this case are equally responsible for it Such officers/officials may include the following
In consequence of the findings contained in paras charge No1 stands proved against the accused officer
In this vies of the matter while the accuse is responsible for not ensuring the mentioning of the correct price per ton on the sale agreement the of the officers are also responsible for ignoring the minutes recorded at para dated… thus in my opinion
The second point for consideration in the charge is whether the accused officer can be held responsible for not incorporating a specific provision in the sale agreement for the imposition of penalty in case of default on the part of the Contractor?
In this vies of the matter it is not possible for me to hold the accused officer guilty of charge NoIII
