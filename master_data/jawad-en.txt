Ministry of National Health Services,
Regulations And Coordination, Islamabad.
Subject: Appreciable Performance by Deputy Director General DRAP (Peshawar)
Madam, 
I on behalf of Federal Investigation Agency Pakistan (Peshawar), feel profound honour on and satisfaction on the positive and professional performance of Mr. Syed Welayat Shah, Deputy Director General (E & M) Drug Regulatory Authority Pakistan (Peshawar) in extending his full support and coordination with FIA to curb the menace of spurious drugs in Khyber Pakhtun Khwa which, I think is a major threat to the health of the ailing humanity. 
In a recent campaign, we very successfully uprooted an international gang involved in the manufacture of fomous brands of multinational life saving drugs at three different premises in Peshawar and Charsadda. 
His technical input to FIA helped a lot in strengthening the prosecution due to which, the accused are  still in jail and their bail applications are rejected by Drug Court and Peshawar High Court. 
I hope, in future, better liaison between the two departments will provide good basis in result oriented services to the public of KP.
2. The credit also goes to the high Authorities of NHSRC & DRA Pakistan for their support and interest .

Yours sincerely,

Dear Miss----------------,
I am writing on behalf of the Prime Minister to thank you for your recent letter. 
While homework is not compulsory, the Government believes that learning from home is an essential part of a good education. 
It is not just about reinforcing what you learn in the classroom, although that is important. A good, well organized homework programme helps children and young people to develop as successful, independent learners throughout their lives.
2. The Prime Minister knows that many schools set homework for their pupils because they believe that homework gives them the chance to practice what they have learnt in school and helps them to make progress with their learning. 
The amount of time young people spend on homework varies from school to school, depending on the age and needs of pupils. 
It is up to your teachers to decide how much homework you should be asked to do and I am pleased that they are encouraging you to offer your views on this issue. 
3. The Prime Minister certainly wants you to be able to enjoy your time at school and also have time to do other things which you enjoy after school and over the school holidays. 
However he also thinks that properly set and marked homework can help you with your learning. 
Thank you again for writing and  1wish you well with your future studies.
Your sincerely,

Subject: Introduction of Urdu as the Official Language
My dear,
Kindly refer to the Presidential Directive No. 22 8of 198 4on the subject noted above. In this connection, I would like to state that about 180 0officers of various Ministries/Divisions have by now completed Daftri Urdu Course being conducted by the Allama lqbal Open University, 
Besides, the first course in Urdu shorthand/typing would conclude by the end of April, 1985. It appears to be necessary that the expertise and technical skill acquired by the trained officers/ officials should not only be retained but it should also be improved. 
Following instructions are accordingly issued for compliance in view of the objective indicated above:
(1) Officers should dispose a part of their official work in Urdu so that stenographers/typists who have received training in Urdu shorthand and typing continue their practice and improve their recently acquired skill. 
Every officer is expected to assess as to how much work he can do in Urdu. The scope of work in Urdu should be gradually expanded.
(2) Brief noting on files may be done in Urdu to the extent possible. 
(3) Correspondence with the various officials in scale (1-4) e.g. Sweeper, Farash, Naib Qasid, Jamadar, Driver etc. may be done in Urdu. 
 (4) Letters received in Urdu may be diarized in Urdu. Replies thereof should also be given in Urdu. In addition, correspondence with the public should be done in Urdu.
 
 
(5) Office orders/internal instructions should be issued in Urdu. Minutes of the internal meetings should be recorded in Urdu. 
(6) Brief orders on fresh receipts e.g. "Please put up immediately"; "Please put up with relevant records" etc. may be recorded and signed in Urdu.
(7) Brief reminders should be issued in Urdu to the extent possible. 
(8) Name plates of officers/ officials should be displayed in Urdu. 
(9) All the work in General Section should be done in Urdu. Demand for various items e.g. stationery etc. should be sent to the General Section in Urdu. 
(10) Leave application should be submitted in Urdu. 
(11) One-third of the stenographers/typists to be recruited in future should have the required skill in both the languages. 
(12) Typewriters to be purchased in future should include Urdu typewriters on the basis of requirements. 
(13) Stationery for official use may be printed in Urdu. 
2. Listed above are some initial steps. With increase in the number of trained officials, the volume of work disposed of in Urdu is expected to increase. 
In some offices Urdu is extensively used prior to issue of these instructions. 
It should be continued and increased as far as possible. 
You are requested to furnish a compliance report on the implementation of these instructions within three months.
Yours sincerely, 
(K.U. Faruqui)

Respected Salman Faruqui Sahib,

It gives me great pleasure to acknowledge with thanks the report on pension reforms which you have kindly forwarded.
The report is quite comprehensive and will go a long way in bringing relief to retired government servants who have been facing a host of problems in finalization of their pension cases.
I feel that the report is a manifestation of your commitment to the cause of a much neglected segment of our society.
Thanking you once again.
Yours Sincerely,

Respected Salman Faruqui Sahib,

Please accept my heart felt appreciation of the effort made by all concerned under your leadership for the benefit of retired personnel.
This should serve as a useful guide for all the pension authorizing offices.
2. As auditor of the pension expenditure budget I feel that it is all the more benefiting that Account/ pensions authorizing offices must strictly comply with the procedures.
3. A recent exercise in the same realm, namely "Special Audit of Pensions" has revealed that pension disbursing agencies like NBP and GPOs have not been following the SOPs giving rise to embezzlement/under/ over payments in pension. 
Similarly, post audit by Account Offices and reconciliation between Account Offices and NBP/GPOs needs efficient handling.
4. This is to assure you that as auditor of public funds, we are highly cognizant of the citizen's hardships and are with you in the efforts to make life better for the people of this country.
With best regards,
Yours Sincerely,
(Rana Assad Amin)

June 30, 2016
Mr. M Salman Faruqui
Thank you for sharing the comprehensive report on pension reforms prepared by the apex committee of experts.
I appreciate the commendable efforts made by your good office to address the long outstanding issues and sufferings of pensioners. 
While the substantive recommendations of the committee will bring about changes in the whole system, a rigorous implementation of these will lead towards achieving excellence of service standards.
State Bank of Pakistan being an autonomous body has its own comprehensive rules & procedures for pension payment. 
You will appreciate that SBP has dedicated Computerized Pension Calls headed by senior officers which enables SBP to finalize the pension cases within a week from the date of retirement of an employee. 
Besides paying pension at SPB counters, the pensioners are also facilitated by direct credit to their bank accounts. 
Additionally separate counters have been established to serve those government pensioners whose pension is drawn on SBP through Accountant Generals Office.  
Sincerely Yours,
Ashraf M. Wathra

Subject: Adverse Remarks in the Performance Evaluation Reports
My dear,
Under the existing instructions on Performance Evaluation: 
(a) All adverse remarks whether remediable or irremediable should be communicated in writing to the officer/official reported upon and copy of the communication placed in the dossier. 
(b) When a report is built on the individual opinions of the reporting and countersigning officers, it is only the opinion as accepted by the latter which should be communicated. 
(c) Remarks once recorded in ACR cannot be altered. If a reporting or countersigning officer changes his views on the officer/official reported upon, it could only be incorporated in the next year's report. 
d) The reporting officer should specifically state whether the defects reported have been already brought in another connection to the notice of the officer/official concerned.
2. As regards communication of adverse remarks the guiding principles are:
(i) As a general rule in no case should an officer/official be kept in total ignorance for any length of time that his superiors after sufficient  experience of his work are dissatisfied with him; in cases where a warning might eradicate or help to eradicate a particular fault, the advantages of prompt communication are obvious. 
(ii) Adverse remarks should be communicated to the officer/official concerned, mainly to enable him to make efforts for improvement. 
(iii) The effect of the communication of adverse entries should be carefully watched and the reporting officer should, when drawing up a report in the next year, state whether the officer/official reported on has or has not taken steps to remedy defect(s) to which his attention was drawn in a previous year. 
Such remarks should also be communicated to him so that he may know that his efforts to improve have not passed unnoticed. 
The method of communication in either case should be the same. 
(The adverse remarks are required to be communicated in writing or verbally. 
In the latter case, the fact of communication should be recorded on the confidential report and, if the officer so requests, the remarks should be given in writing.) 
3. The above guidelines have been taken from the Establishment Division (Management Services Wing) handbook on "A Guide to Performance Evaluation" (1991) and may be of interest to most of us who are required to submit reports, to countersign them or to tackle representations in cases of adverse evaluation. 
4. The need for exactitude in judgement and precision in observations are the inescapable minimum requirements of constructive performance evaluation. 
There is no room for after-thoughts, shoddy judgements or complicated subjectivism in assessment reports.
5. A report rendered recently on an official bristled witi: contradictions and tentative statements. 
The Reporting Officer's Pen Picture was as follow:
"He needs strict supervision and watch for normal functioning. 
For better performance one has to rely on managerial skills and tacts."
The Countersigning Officer's Pen Picture reads as under:
"He has done a good job but tends to be over enthusiastic and attempts to take credit for all his minor and major accomplishments. 
I must say he is resourceful but in his exuberance tends to overstep his jurisdiction." 
6. For the subsequent year, the Reporting Officer's Pen Picture was: "He posses(sic) enough experience to carry out routine tasks as a matter of his duty, yet he wishes to take credit for the paid jobs. 
A tactful disciplinary attitude would keep him on right track." The Countersigning Officer's Pen-Picture stated: "A very competent (official) who can be very efficient when he wants to be extremely resourceful but rather too boastful of his performance which could put off his superiors. Professionally sound but must learn to remain within bounds of his responsibilities." 
7. Together with a few other entries, these were treated as adverse remarks and communicated to the official who promptly represented. 
In his reply the Reporting Officer stated that "there was no intention to give adverse report" and recommended its upgradation. 
8. The above is just an illustration of the greater need for us to have a sound approach in formulating adverse entries in performance evaluation reports. 
Yours sincerely,
(-------name-------)

Ban against mentioning of Unfinalized Departmental Proceedings in Confidential Reports) Letter from Establishment Division to all the Federal Secretaries 
It has been noticed that in some "Annual Confidential Reports*" of officers received from various Ministries, a reference is made to departmental proceedings which are still in progress against the officers concerned.
2. The Establishment Division feel that until and unless the result of such proceedings has been known and final orders, awarding punishment, if any, have been passed by the competent authority, it would not be connect to make any such reference as may have the effect of creating doubts about the conduct and character of the officers concerned. 
It can hardly be controverted that such a reference, although factually correct, if advertantly made, cannot fail to damage the officer's record even if in the long run, he is completely exonerated. 
3. In the circumstances, it is requested  that in the case of an officer against whom departmental proceedings are in progress, no mention, whatsoever , should be made about it in his "Annual Confidential Reports." 
Only when such proceedings have been finalized and the punishment, if any, has been awarded, should a mention about it be made in the Confidential Report. 
In such a case, a complete copy of the final order may be placed, as is usually done on his character roll.

Yours sincerely,
