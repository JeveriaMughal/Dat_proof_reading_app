Ministry of National Health Services,
Regulations And Coordination, Islamabad.
Subject: Appreciable Performance by Deputy Director General DRAP (Peshawar)
Madam, 
I on behalf of Federal Investigation Agency Pakistan (Peshawar), feel profound honour on and satisfaction on the positive and professional performance of Mr. Syed Welayat Shah, Deputy Director General (E & M) Drug Regulatory Authority Pakistan (Peshawar) in extending his full support and coordination with FIA to curb the menace of spurious drugs in Khyber Pakhtun Khwa which, I think is a major threat to the health of the ailing humanity. 
In a recent campaign, we very successfully uprooted an international gang involved in the manufacture of fomous brands of multinational life saving drugs at three different premises in Peshawar and Charsadda. 
His technical input to FIA helped a lot in strengthening the prosecution due to which, the accused are  still in jail and their bail applications are rejected by Drug Court and Peshawar High Court. 
I hope, in future, better liaison between the two departments will provide good basis in result oriented services to the public of KP.
2. The credit also goes to the high Authorities of NHSRC & DRA Pakistan for their support and interest .

Yours sincerely,

Dear Miss----------------,
I am writing on behalf of the Prime Minister to thank you for your recent letter. 
While homework is not compulsory, the Government believes that learning from home is an essential part of a good education. 
It is not just about reinforcing what you learn in the classroom, although that is important. A good, well organized homework programme helps children and young people to develop as successful, independent learners throughout their lives.
2. The Prime Minister knows that many schools set homework for their pupils because they believe that homework gives them the chance to practice what they have learnt in school and helps them to make progress with their learning. 
The amount of time young people spend on homework varies from school to school, depending on the age and needs of pupils. 
It is up to your teachers to decide how much homework you should be asked to do and I am pleased that they are encouraging you to offer your views on this issue. 
3. The Prime Minister certainly wants you to be able to enjoy your time at school and also have time to do other things which you enjoy after school and over the school holidays. 
However he also thinks that properly set and marked homework can help you with your learning. 
Thank you again for writing and  1wish you well with your future studies.
Your sincerely,

Subject: Introduction of Urdu as the Official Language
My dear,
Kindly refer to the Presidential Directive No. 22 8of 198 4on the subject noted above. In this connection, I would like to state that about 180 0officers of various Ministries/Divisions have by now completed Daftri Urdu Course being conducted by the Allama lqbal Open University, 
Besides, the first course in Urdu shorthand/typing would conclude by the end of April, 1985. It appears to be necessary that the expertise and technical skill acquired by the trained officers/ officials should not only be retained but it should also be improved. 
Following instructions are accordingly issued for compliance in view of the objective indicated above:
(1) Officers should dispose a part of their official work in Urdu so that stenographers/typists who have received training in Urdu shorthand and typing continue their practice and improve their recently acquired skill. 
Every officer is expected to assess as to how much work he can do in Urdu. The scope of work in Urdu should be gradually expanded.
(2) Brief noting on files may be done in Urdu to the extent possible. 
(3) Correspondence with the various officials in scale (1-4) e.g. Sweeper, Farash, Naib Qasid, Jamadar, Driver etc. may be done in Urdu. 
 (4) Letters received in Urdu may be diarized in Urdu. Replies thereof should also be given in Urdu. In addition, correspondence with the public should be done in Urdu.
 
 
(5) Office orders/internal instructions should be issued in Urdu. Minutes of the internal meetings should be recorded in Urdu. 
(6) Brief orders on fresh receipts e.g. "Please put up immediately"; "Please put up with relevant records" etc. may be recorded and signed in Urdu.
(7) Brief reminders should be issued in Urdu to the extent possible. 
(8) Name plates of officers/ officials should be displayed in Urdu. 
(9) All the work in General Section should be done in Urdu. Demand for various items e.g. stationery etc. should be sent to the General Section in Urdu. 
(10) Leave application should be submitted in Urdu. 
(11) One-third of the stenographers/typists to be recruited in future should have the required skill in both the languages. 
(12) Typewriters to be purchased in future should include Urdu typewriters on the basis of requirements. 
(13) Stationery for official use may be printed in Urdu. 
2. Listed above are some initial steps. With increase in the number of trained officials, the volume of work disposed of in Urdu is expected to increase. 
In some offices Urdu is extensively used prior to issue of these instructions. 
It should be continued and increased as far as possible. 
You are requested to furnish a compliance report on the implementation of these instructions within three months.
Yours sincerely, 
(K.U. Faruqui)

Respected Salman Faruqui Sahib,

It gives me great pleasure to acknowledge with thanks the report on pension reforms which you have kindly forwarded.
The report is quite comprehensive and will go a long way in bringing relief to retired government servants who have been facing a host of problems in finalization of their pension cases.
I feel that the report is a manifestation of your commitment to the cause of a much neglected segment of our society.
Thanking you once again.

Respected Salman Faruqui Sahib,

Please accept my heart felt appreciation of the effort made by all concerned under your leadership for the benefit of retired personnel.
This should serve as a useful guide for all the pension authorizing offices.
2. As auditor of the pension expenditure budget I feel that it is all the more benefiting that Account/ pensions authorizing offices must strictly comply with the procedures.
3. A recent exercise in the same realm, namely "Special Audit of Pensions" has revealed that pension disbursing agencies like NBP and GPOs have not been following the SOPs giving rise to embezzlement/under/ over payments in pension. 
Similarly, post audit by Account Offices and reconciliation between Account Offices and NBP/GPOs needs efficient handling.
4. This is to assure you that as auditor of public funds, we are highly cognizant of the citizen's hardships and are with you in the efforts to make life better for the people of this country.
With best regards,
Yours Sincerely,
(Rana Assad Amin)

Mr. M Salman Faruqui
Thank you for sharing the comprehensive report on pension reforms prepared by the apex committee of experts.
I appreciate the commendable efforts made by your good office to address the long outstanding issues and sufferings of pensioners. 
While the substantive recommendations of the committee will bring about changes in the whole system, a rigorous implementation of these will lead towards achieving excellence of service standards.
State Bank of Pakistan being an autonomous body has its own comprehensive rules & procedures for pension payment. 
You will appreciate that SBP has dedicated Computerized Pension Calls headed by senior officers which enables SBP to finalize the pension cases within a week from the date of retirement of an employee. 
Besides paying pension at SPB counters, the pensioners are also facilitated by direct credit to their bank accounts. 
Additionally separate counters have been established to serve those government pensioners whose pension is drawn on SBP through Accountant Generals Office.  
Sincerely Yours,
Ashraf M. Wathra

Subject: Adverse Remarks in the Performance Evaluation Reports
My dear,
Under the existing instructions on Performance Evaluation: 
(a) All adverse remarks whether remediable or irremediable should be communicated in writing to the officer/official reported upon and copy of the communication placed in the dossier. 
(b) When a report is built on the individual opinions of the reporting and countersigning officers, it is only the opinion as accepted by the latter which should be communicated. 
(c) Remarks once recorded in ACR cannot be altered. If a reporting or countersigning officer changes his views on the officer/official reported upon, it could only be incorporated in the next year's report. 
d) The reporting officer should specifically state whether the defects reported have been already brought in another connection to the notice of the officer/official concerned.
2. As regards communication of adverse remarks the guiding principles are:
(i) As a general rule in no case should an officer/official be kept in total ignorance for any length of time that his superiors after sufficient  experience of his work are dissatisfied with him; in cases where a warning might eradicate or help to eradicate a particular fault, the advantages of prompt communication are obvious. 
(ii) Adverse remarks should be communicated to the officer/official concerned, mainly to enable him to make efforts for improvement. 
(iii) The effect of the communication of adverse entries should be carefully watched and the reporting officer should, when drawing up a report in the next year, state whether the officer/official reported on has or has not taken steps to remedy defect(s) to which his attention was drawn in a previous year. 
Such remarks should also be communicated to him so that he may know that his efforts to improve have not passed unnoticed. 
The method of communication in either case should be the same. 
(The adverse remarks are required to be communicated in writing or verbally. 
In the latter case, the fact of communication should be recorded on the confidential report and, if the officer so requests, the remarks should be given in writing.) 
3. The above guidelines have been taken from the Establishment Division (Management Services Wing) handbook on "A Guide to Performance Evaluation" (1991) and may be of interest to most of us who are required to submit reports, to countersign them or to tackle representations in cases of adverse evaluation. 
4. The need for exactitude in judgement and precision in observations are the inescapable minimum requirements of constructive performance evaluation. 
There is no room for after-thoughts, shoddy judgements or complicated subjectivism in assessment reports.
5. A report rendered recently on an official bristled witi: contradictions and tentative statements. 
The Reporting Officer's Pen Picture was as follow:
"He needs strict supervision and watch for normal functioning. 
For better performance one has to rely on managerial skills and tacts."
The Countersigning Officer's Pen Picture reads as under:
"He has done a good job but tends to be over enthusiastic and attempts to take credit for all his minor and major accomplishments. 
I must say he is resourceful but in his exuberance tends to overstep his jurisdiction." 
6. For the subsequent year, the Reporting Officer's Pen Picture was: "He posses(sic) enough experience to carry out routine tasks as a matter of his duty, yet he wishes to take credit for the paid jobs. 
A tactful disciplinary attitude would keep him on right track." The Countersigning Officer's Pen-Picture stated: "A very competent (official) who can be very efficient when he wants to be extremely resourceful but rather too boastful of his performance which could put off his superiors. Professionally sound but must learn to remain within bounds of his responsibilities." 
7. Together with a few other entries, these were treated as adverse remarks and communicated to the official who promptly represented. 
In his reply the Reporting Officer stated that "there was no intention to give adverse report" and recommended its upgradation. 
8. The above is just an illustration of the greater need for us to have a sound approach in formulating adverse entries in performance evaluation reports. 
Yours sincerely,

Ban against mentioning of Unfinalized Departmental Proceedings in Confidential Reports) Letter from Establishment Division to all the Federal Secretaries 
It has been noticed that in some "Annual Confidential Reports*" of officers received from various Ministries, a reference is made to departmental proceedings which are still in progress against the officers concerned.
2. The Establishment Division feel that until and unless the result of such proceedings has been known and final orders, awarding punishment, if any, have been passed by the competent authority, it would not be connect to make any such reference as may have the effect of creating doubts about the conduct and character of the officers concerned. 
It can hardly be controverted that such a reference, although factually correct, if advertantly made, cannot fail to damage the officer's record even if in the long run, he is completely exonerated. 
3. In the circumstances, it is requested  that in the case of an officer against whom departmental proceedings are in progress, no mention, whatsoever , should be made about it in his "Annual Confidential Reports." 
Only when such proceedings have been finalized and the punishment, if any, has been awarded, should a mention about it be made in the Confidential Report. 
In such a case, a complete copy of the final order may be placed, as is usually done on his character roll.

Respected  Mr. Salman Faruqui,   
   
It is a matter of immense honour for me to receive committee reports prepared under your able guidance on the directions of the Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan on very pertinent and core issues pertaining "Maladministration in Police Department" and "Systematic Failures in the Administration of Prisons." 
The Honourable Court's decision to entrust your good office for such significant task is a reflection of the confidence which the Honourable Court has in your department. 
I would take this opportunity to appreciate the efforts of both committees on comprehensive and well-researched work. 
The committee probed pertinent issues from all relevant angles and has come up with a comprehensive way ahead to eradicate the weaknesses in the existing administration of Police and Prisons.
Although the committee has endeavored to unearth all possible issues in respective domains, however few suggestions are being made for your kind consideration to add value to the research work. 
The same are enclosed.
I hope you will find my view point useful and a value addition to a work, already very well done. 
I thank you for sharing your research reports with us and for giving me an opportunity to contribute towards improvement of the two important departments of the state.

Dear Mr. Salman Faruqui,
Assalam,-o-Alaikum
It gives me immense pleasure to acknowledge the colossal efforts put in by the Department of Federal Ombudsman of Pakistan under your leadership in bringing up the "Report of The Committee to Examine the Systemic Failures in the Administration of Prisons and to Recommend Good Administration Standards" and "Report on Addressing Mal-Administration Police Stations"
2. The recommendations in the report on addressing Mal-administration in Police Stations especially in terms of transparency, an efficient system of FIR registration  and follow up of investigations, establishment of state of the art Forensic Service Agencies along with training of investigation officers can remarkably improve the police services in the best interest of a common person of our society.
 3. Pakistan Air force is already in the process of establishing correction and rehabilitation centre for PAF prisoners. The report on failures in administration of prisons and recommendations for good administration is a valuable guidance for PAF in an endeavor to establish an effective correction and rehabilitation centre.
4. In the end, I must appreciate your untiring efforts in reshaping the prisons of Pakistan on the contemporary lines. May Allah grant you the courage, fortitude and wisdom to serve this great Nation to the best of your capabilities and in the highest traditions of Department of Federal Ombudsman of Pakistan.

Dear Mr.,
As you are aware, in the wake of reforms initiated in the Ministry of Planning, Development & Reform/Planning Commission, the workload of this Ministry has been diversified to a larger extent. 
This Ministry, inter alia, has been assigned the implementation task of Vision 202 5to lead the country's growth strategy. 
After restructuring of Planning Commission in 2013, the posts of Members (MP- 1Scale) have also been increased from 0 9to 12. 
2. In order to achieve time bound tasks, this Ministry is in dire need of the required administrative support. 
At present, out of 14 sanctioned posts of Section Officers, 07 are lying vacant. 
Presently the acute shortage is being managed through internal arrangements by assigning the duties of Section Officers to Research Officers and Assistant Chiefs of the Ministry. 
However, these temporary arrangements may not continue for long. 
3. In view of the above, I shall be grateful if 07 Section Officers may please be posted in this Ministry at the earliest. 
Yours sincerely,

It was providential that Your Honour, as the Chief Justice of this not infrequently beleaguered country, took notice of the inhuman plight of the thousands of prison inmates in Pakistan and directed the Office of the Wafaqi Mohtasib (Federal Ombudsman) of Pakistan to form standing committee/s and inspection team/s to examine the systemic failures in the administrations of the criminal justice system and the prisons in particular and make recommendations to rectify such failures and set good administration standards that, if breached, would be deemed to be maladministration. 
I have used the word providential because I believe that had the Honourable Supreme Court not taken suo moto notice of the hapless poor, the wheels of much needed reforms would not have moved and the undeserved miseries inflicted on these thousands of men, women and children would have continued unchecked. 
By directing us to do that, the Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan has earned the gratitude of the people and has also set a healthy precedence of drawing the attention of the Executive to systemic failures that heap undue sufferings and inflict miseries on the citizens.
Sir, drawing inspiration from your direction, this Office and members of the National Committee on Prisons have spared no effort to visit, inspect, study and analyse the situation as it exists in various prisons of the country. 
Headed by the distinguished Senator(R), Mr. S.M. Zafar, former President of Human Rights Society of Pakistan and Minister for Law and Justice, the Committee included eminent educationists, serving and retired civil servants and prominent civil society activists. 
What unfolded before them is too horrifying to describe. 
To put it mildly, while there is noticeable improvement, thanks due to serious efforts by the Inspectors General of Prisons and some of their colleagues in some of the prisons, the conditions continue to be grossly inhuman. 
But instead of dampening, it, in fact only ignited the zeal and the passion of the members to go ahead with the mission that they had accepted to carry forward. 
They took exceptional pain and stress to reach to the bottom of the malaise, identify the systemic failures and bring forward a set of recommendations that are pragmatic and practicable. 
In dong so, they have earned the admiration of us all.
3. It is, thus, with a sense of satisfaction and indeed pride in the extraordinary efforts of the Committee that I take this opportunity to present to you its comprehensive report. 
I do so in the belief that their efforts will lead to the setting up of systems and principles that will ensure that the prison inmates in Pakistan are treated humanely and justly, specially the women and children.
Sincerely,
(M. Salman Faruqui)

Assalam-o-Alaikum
I am pleased to acknowledge the receipt of Ombudsman's Report of the National Committee on Prisons constituted by the Federal Ombudsman of Pakistan in pursuance of the orders of the Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan. 
2. The Committee has carried out invaluable work to identify the perennial problems existing in our prison system. The report charts a clear way that promises to usher the much needed reform, particularly for the good of incarcerated women and juveniles. 
3. The prisons can play an important role in reformation of the inmates to equip them with elementary/better education and skills during their internment or sentence and prepare them to become useful citizens upon returning to the society. This area has been paid little attention in the past. 
4. The Committee's report with a set of recommendations to redress this situation is an important step that deserves due recognition and necessary follow up. 
With best wishes and warm regards.
Yours sincerely,

Subject: Redress of Grievances Redressal And Principal Accounting Officers
My dear Secretary, 
Pivotal position of Principal Accounting Officer in our system of governance needs no underscoring nor can the importance of transparency in procurement process be minimized. 
Part and parcel of transparency is the mechanism to redress grievance. 
2. PPRA, has sufficiently brought out the rule position of grievance handling along with the requirement to form Grievance Redressal Committees. 
This request did not meet a resounding response; the result can be viewed at www.ppra.org.pk where Committees stand uploaded for the benefit of aggrieved bidders and the public to meet the tenets of transparency. 
3. To strengthen the mechanism as provided under Rule 4 8of Public Procurement Rules 2004, the Principal Accounting Officer as a next logical step should conduct an administrative review on the findings of complaint and take action in accordance with conduct rules in the event of unfair and non-transparent procurement process. 
The decision of administrative review shall be communicated to PPRA, the aggrieved bidder and the procuring entity prior to the award of contract without retarding the procurement process. 
4. The intent is to complete the first tier Grievance Redressal mechanism. 
The second tier is under active deliberation.

My dear Secretary, 
It has been observed that in many cases/procuring agencies prefer registration of firms by charging exorbitant registration feel processing fee and few other charges instead of adhering to Rules 1 5& 1 6of Public Procurement Rules, 2004. 
Such practices are in conflict with the basic objective of holding healthy competition among the suppliers/contractors or service providers. 
Public Procurement Rules, 200 4allow procuring agencies to charge price of pre qualification/bidding documents only to cover costs of printing.

Preparation of Annual Procurement Plan by every procuring agency of the Federal Government and its uploading on the PPRA website and the procuring agency's own website (if any) is mandatory, in terms of Rule  8&  9of the Public Procurement Rules 2004. 
Failure to do so straightaway leads to mis-procurement which cannot be condoned either under the PPRA Ordinance, 200 2or any other law of the land. 
2. Inspite of the above clear cut mandatory requirements of the Rules, most of the procurement agencies neither prepare their Annual Procurement Plans nor upload them on the PPRA website before start of actual procurement. 
Please note that any procurement without a publicized procurement plan on the PPRA website is a mis- procurement, under the Rules. 
3. Since the new financial year is going to start w.e.f. 01-07-2014, all procuring agencies are requested to prepare and upload their respective plans on the PPRA's website on the enclosed proforma before initiating the actual procurements. 
From July 2014, the procurement advertisements of the defaulting organizations will be marked by the Authority as violation of the Rules 8,  9of the Public Procurement Rules, 200 4and conveyed to the respective procuring agencies.

Dear Salman Faruqui,
Reference your letter of 31st October, 201 6and the report on Government procurement system. The reason for answering with some delay is the time consumed for going through the entire report.
During my practice I had to defend some of the cases of procurement by the Government.
Through the study thereof, the observations by the judges during the hearing and in the final judgment, I was hoping that the procedure and the system of Government procurements will be properly re-framed. 
The report, therefore, was a good news to me that some serious efforts have been made in this regard which may improve the task for the Standing Committee and the Senate on this subject. 
However, what has irritated me in the past, through the experience inside and outside the Government, is that the reports are received as welcome by the governments and are ignored similarly by the swift hands sending them to incompetent bureaucratic committees. 
So, I may suggest that after sending a report like this one and others, the Ombudsman office under your guidance may ensure that the recommendations have been acted upon and implemented. 
Otherwise your and our efforts will only add to dustbin and our frustration. 
There must be a system by which we can inquire from the government, after reasonable time, the result of receiving the report. 
Yours sincerely,
(Senator Dr. S.M. Zafar)

Dear Salman Faruqui Sahib,
It is with deep gratitude that I received your letter of 13th October 201 6along with a copy of 'Federal Ombudsman Report on Government Procurement System to Address Maladministration and Ensure Transparency'. 
In recognition of economic challenges facing our country, implementation of the committee's recommendations across the public domain would bring in cost efficiencies, while maximizing the operational as well as administrative utility of our scarce budget. 
The contents of the report are being disseminated within Pakistan Navy for guidance and education of concerned staff. 
2. Pakistan Navy has always endeavoured to extract best value for the limited budget allocated by MoD within the bounds of PPRA and procurement rules promulgated by MoDP/DGDP. 
A number of new initiatives have been taken to streamline the procurement process in PN. 
These include prioritization of naval staff requirements, transparent bidding process and institution of Standing Appeals Committee to redress legitimate grievances of suppliers. 
Pakistan Navy has also setup procurement Management System for electronic processing of contractual activities. 
3. I thank you and extend our full support towards your noble pursuits.

My Dear Mohtram Faruqui Sahib,
Assalam-o-Alaikum,
I would like to extend my gratitude to you for sharing with us the "Federal, Ombudsman report on Government procurement system to address maladministration and ensure transparency''
The report shows indelible mark of your leadership. Transparency is a key principle for good governance and national development. 
It increases predictability and enhances confidence in institutions on the basis of adequate legislation and the rule of law. 
If we can address systemic weaknesses through financial transparency and fairness in procurement of goods and services, heavy chunks of public resources would be saved and spent on development projects. 
Rather than dealing with routine matters, the report effectively deals with the causes of malpractices in government departments in procurement of goods and services.
I  hope the Government of Pakistan would take full advantage of the report's valuale recommendations.

I personally feel honored and grateful to you, for timely sharing with us, this excellent analysis on public procurement. 
The balanced and in-depth analysis on the whole range of procurement issues alongwith recommendations speaks volumes about the level of efforts invested by the team members. 
As a leading public sector institution, SBP is strictly complying with Public Procurement Rules issued by the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority; however, I am confident that the quality content of this report would be of great help to further strengthen the procurement policy and procedures of our organization. It will also help the legislature and policy makers in making the required changes that will boister and enhance "value for money" procurements, while maintaining transparency in the procurement process. 
I, once again extend my appreciation to your good self for this public interest initiative and to all the team members for sharing their insights through this report. 
Warmest personal regards, 
Yours Sincerely,
(Ashraf M. Wathra)

Subject: Proposal for Free and Speedy Resolutions of Citizens Complaints Against Maladministration of Federal, Provincial and Local Governments
My dear Mr. M. Salman Faruqui,
The purpose of this note is to thank you for your letter No. 1(10)/HWM/201 4dated May 26, 201 5regarding the subject matter.
2. It is indeed impressive to note that under your esteemed leadership, the office of Federal Ombudsman is remarkably contributing towards provision of speedy and inexpensive justice to common man of Pakistan.
I sincerely congratulate you and your team for tremendous achievements made over the years in complaint redressal. With your passion, commitment and leadership, I am confident that the institution of Wafaqi Mohtasib would continue to excel. It gives me immense pleasure to relate with your objective of providing speedy and fair justice to masses which principally is an essential pillar of Financial Consumer Protection, one of the top priority areas for State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).
An impartial and efficient external dispute resolution forum, in case of banking sector, is the office of Banking Mohtasib Pakistan (BMP).
We in SBP are working to enhance coordination and cooperation with the BMP to make it a preferred redressal choice of banking customers so that SBP could focus on supervision of conduct of the banks and strengthen its regulatory regime.
I would like to take this opportunity to call your attention to the following concerns that have emerged as a result of Federal Ombudsman Institutional Reform Act. 2013.


Banking Consumer is legally compelled to give a 45 day's notice to bank before filing a complaint with BMP which is antagonistic to the concept of speedy justice specially in banking industry where grievances require immediate action. 
Resultantly, SBP is coerced to run a parallel redressal forum which handled 643 4complaints in FY14-1 5as compared to 4506 complaints dealt at BMP.
There appears an overlap of jurisdiction between Wafaqi/Provincial Ombudsmen and BMP regarding banking disputes where the later have power to entertain complaints against both public as well as private banks. 
Thus, there is a need to formulate a working mechanism amongst the Ombudsmen to eradicate duplication of work.
I extend my full support and cooperation to further strengthen the institution of Wafaqi Mohtasib and achieve its objectives.

Subject: Access to Unclassified Official Records
My dear Secretary,
It has been emphasized from time to time that due attention should be paid to the collection and preservation of official records, publications and other materials as archives or public documents and their optimum utilization for official purposes, research and study ensured. 
A copy of the President's latest directive (No.38 9of 1985) on the subject is enclosed. 
2.	It is generally felt that the prescribed procedures governing declassification of official records are not being followed, leading often to their non-transmittal to archives repositories concerned and their consequential inaccessibility for study and research by scholars and others. 
It is accordingly requested that the Ministries/Divisions of the Federal Government and the various Departments of the Provincial Governments should arrange, at designated points, to make available to interested people at least unclassified printed official materials, reports, memoranda and documents in their custody. 
This should to some extent mitigate public grievance.

Subject: Briefing of delegations going abroad
My dear,
A case has come to notice where a delegation had not been provided with a clear brief and the delegates also, on their part, had not undertaken to apprise themselves of the guidelines framed and issued by the Government regarding their conduct and behaviour abroad. 
The result was that, owing to their ignorance of rules and procedures, the delegation signed a document in a foreign country without proper authorization which could place the Government of Pakistan in an embarrassing situation. 
2. The matter was brought to notice of the President who has been pleased to direct that attention of all Ministries/Divisions and the Provincial Governments should be drawn to the requirement of briefing all delegations going abroad. 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs had issued a booklet called "Guidance for Pakistan delegations to International Conferences, Meetings etc.," in 197 2which is being re-circulated separately to all concerned for strict observance. However an extract from Para 2 3thereof is enclosed for your immediate reference.
3. You are accordingly requested to kindly note the above directions of the President and to ensure that all delegations proceeding abroad are properly briefed and the instructions issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in this behalf strictly observed. 
4. In the meantime kindly acknowledge receipt. 
Your sincerely,
(Asad Ali Shah)

Enclosure
"Guidance for Pakistan delegations to International Conferences, meetings etc.".
Extract from para 2 3of the bookket published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs booklet
"23. A delegation is expected to strictly adhere to the Government's instructions set out in the brief. In case unexpected issues come up during discussions, you should not commit yourself without prior instructions from the Government. 
Sometimes the brief given by the sponsoring Ministry contains guidelines on major policy issues. In case issues arise which are not covered by the brief, ask for time to enable you to obtain instructions from home. 
It is essential to remember that you should not take a decision on your own initiative which may involve a commitment on the part of your Government against its policies".

Subject: Alternate Dispute Resolution 
Dear Salman,
Thank you so much for your letter dated 1 8February 2015. Please accept my compliments for the quick and effective relief provided to the public during your tenure.
The initiative for recourse to the Alternative Dispute Resolution is long overdue. 
Our judicial system is the weakest part of the British legacy that has been concerned more with law than justice. 
It has simply failed to perform the service it was expected.
As reforming the judicial system would be long and difficult process, the only feasible recourse is ADR. 
I wish you success in this initiative.
With best regards,
Yours sincerely,
(Saeed Ahmad Qureshi)

Dear Salman Faruqui,
Thank you for your letter dated 26. 5102 2 along with a copy of study report on the ADR. 
Apparently, you have been able to eliminate the backlog of pending cases altogether, and I am glad to know that the time span for deciding a complaint has been reduced to  2 months. 
This is no mean achievement. 
It has become possible because of your dedication/commitment to the task. 
It is good to know or come across such success stories about State institutions, which is both heartening and spirit-elevating. 
Congratulations to you and your team members in the Office of Federal Ombudsman. The study, 'Alternate Dispute Resolution at the Gross Root Level, will be a useful addition to our Library, which is used for research by trainee judges/justice sector professional.
With profound regards, 
Yours sincerely,
